        Know that there are mochin [intellects] of the Land of Israel, and there are mochin of outside the Land. And also the mochin of outside the Land receive and suckle also from the mochin of the Land of Israel. For the primary intellect and wisdom is in the Land of Israel, as our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said in the Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah, Parashah 16): There is no wisdom like the wisdom of the Land of Israel, etc. And every one from Israel has a portion in the Land of Israel. And every one according to his portion that he has in the Land of Israel, so he receives and suckles from the mochin of the Land of Israel. Thus, all the mochin are the aspect of mochin of the Land of Israel, for all of them receive from there. For there in the Land of Israel is the primary intellect and wisdom, as mentioned above. But nevertheless, there are mochin of outside the Land. And this is made through the blemish of the glory, Heaven forbid.

      <div class="hebrew-quote">
        יֵשׁ מֹחִין שֶׁל אֶרֶץ יִשְׂרָאֵל
      </div>

      <p>
        For one who blemishes, Heaven forbid, in the glory of Hashem, blessed is He, then through the blemish of the glory of Hashem, blessed is He, they cannot receive and suckle from the mochin of the Land of Israel. And according to the blemish that he blemish in the glory of Hashem, blessed is He, so he cannot receive and suckle from the mochin of the Land of Israel. And then the mochin remain in the aspect of mochin of outside the Land literally. And when the mochin are the aspect of mochin of outside the Land, then they cannot equalize their mind together. And this is the aspect of the controversy that there is in the world. For mochin of outside the Land cannot equalize themselves together. But it would have been proper that there be no controversy except outside the Land. And in truth we see that also in the Land of Israel there is controversy. But know, that these mochin of outside the Land that are made through the blemish of the glory, as mentioned above, they seek for themselves repair. And the repair of these mochin of outside the Land is at the time when the supernal pleasantness flows. Through this the revelation of the glory is made. Then it is the time of their repair, of these mochin of outside the Land. For glory is the repair of the world.

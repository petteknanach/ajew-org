<font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Know
that there are twenty-four kinds of redemptions because there are
twenty-four courts of judgment (see Adir BaMarom Naso 136: and in
Adra Zuta 293) and corresponding to each court and court there is a
special redemption to sweeten the judgment that is there, therefore
sometimes the redemption that they do does not help because not every
one and one knows all the twenty-four redemptions and even if he
knows them he does not do all of them, and therefore when he does not
do the redemption special to that judgment by this it does not help.
But know, that there is one redemption that includes all the
twenty-four courts of judgment and can sweeten all the twenty-four
courts of judgment, and for this redemption one needs a time of favor
aspects of revelation of the forehead of will like on Shabbos at
Minchah, aspects of&nbsp;</font></font></font><font color="#0000ff"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>&quot;And
I my prayer etc., time of favor&quot;</b></font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;etc.
[Psalms 69] but even the tzadikim, not every one knows this
redemption and it is not found except one in a generation who knows
this redemption, and sometimes even when this tzadik does a
redemption nevertheless it does not help and this is because also
above they desire very much for such a redemption because not every
time comes to them from below such a redemption that can sweeten all
the twenty-four courts of judgment at once, and therefore when this
sweetening comes to them they use it for another thing that is that
by this redemption and sweetening, converts are made because all the
time that there is idolatry in the world there is wrath in the world
(Sifri Parshas Re'eh) and when they sweeten the judgment and the
wrath, the idolatry is sweetened and converts are made, and this was
the service of Moses our teacher, peace be upon him, all the days of
his life, and also after his death because he strove to bring close
the mixed multitude in order to make converts, and also in his death
he was buried opposite Beit Peor, in order to sweeten the idolatry in
order that they should be made converts, and therefore he departed on
Shabbos at Minchah that then it is time of favor in order to sweeten
all the twenty-four courts of judgment as above in order to make
converts because all the service of Moses, to sweeten the wrath of
the idolatry to will, and therefore Moses stands between destruction
to will because the number Moses is average, between the number
destruction to the number will because he stands always to sweeten
the destruction to turn it to will as above, and therefore we find in
the Midrash that Rabbi Eliezer the Great (see Bereishis Rabbah
Vayeitzei Parsha 70 and in Midrash Rabbah Koheles) converted converts
and this is because he was a reincarnation of the son of Moses
because on him it is said:&nbsp;</font></font></font><font color="#0000ff"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>&quot;And
the name of one Eliezer&quot;</b></font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;[Exodus
18] as brought (Midrash Rabbah Bamidbar Parsha 19) and therefore by
this strength he converted converts, and similarly Yitro because he
was the father-in-law of Moses by this he converted as it is
written&nbsp;</font></font></font><font color="#0000ff"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>&quot;And
Yitro heard the father-in-law of Moses&quot;</b></font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;because
because he was the father-in-law of Moses this caused him that he
heard and converted because all the service of Moses in his life and
now after his death is only to make converts as above.</font></font></font></p>

FREEDOM - LIBERTY - EMANCIPATION Tuesday, July 22, 2025 Likutay Moharan - Torah-teaching 59 59 - One Who Always Strives to Bring People Close to the Service of Hashem Blessed Be He [In the language of our Rebbe, of blessed memory] 1. One who always strives to bring people close to the service of Hashem blessed be He needs to guard himself that the klipos (shells [evil forces]) and the ra (evil) of these people should not attach to him. For this man who strives to bring close and to make nefashos (souls) in the aspect of: " And the nefesh that they had made in Charan " [Genesis 12:5], he builds the aspect of the heichal hakodesh (holy sanctuary) : " And the remnant in Jerusalem shall be called kadosh [holy] " [Isaiah 4:3], which is, this that people remain attached in complete yirah (fear) [see Bereishit Rabbah 56 and Bereishit Rabbah 2 on "beautiful as Jerusalem"] through him, even though there are many and many who fell from their kedushah (holiness) , nevertheless from these who remained in complete yirah through this " kadosh shall be said to him ". And this is the aspect of kodesh (holy) and heichal (sanctuary) , this is the aspect of the kavod (glory) that Hashem blessed be He is honored: When Yitro came, then the name of the Holy One blessed be He was honored [Zohar Yitro 69a]. And this is the aspect of: " Tell among the nations His kavod " [Psalms 96:3], that through bringing themselves close to the service of Hashem blessed be He, these who were far, this is His kavod blessed be His name: " And in His heichal everyone speaks of kavod " [Psalms 29:9]. And this heichal hakodesh draws itself constantly to its shoresh (root) , which is to the lev (heart) of its maker, for there is its shoresh , for because of the devarim (words) that came out from the depth of the lev of this kosher (upright) man, they entered into their lev and they returned to Hashem blessed be He. And this heichal hakodesh dwells and clothes the ruach hachiyuni (vital spirit) that is in the lev of the kosher man, for the ruach is in the lev in the aspect of: " And I will give you a new lev and a new ruach " [Ezekiel 36:26]. And the heichal hakodesh suckles its vitality from this ruach in the aspect of: " And the lowly of ruach shall uphold kavod " [Proverbs 29:23]. " And ruach to them that walk therein " [Isaiah 42:5], from the aspect of raglayim (feet) is aroused to straighten people to the service of Hashem blessed be He, in the aspect of: " Make straight in the aravah [desert] a mesilah [highway] for our G-d " [Isaiah 40:3], mesilah precisely, which is the place of the raglayim : " Mesilos [highways] in their levavam [hearts] " [Psalms 84:6], that through mesilos in their levavam is aroused to straighten people who dwell in the aravah and in choshech (darkness) to straighten for them a derech (way) to the service of Hashem blessed be He. And because the heichal above is made from the nefashos who were far until now and there are many klipos dwelling around them, in the aspect of: " This is Jerusalem, I have set her among the nations " [Ezekiel 5:5]. And it is possible now when the heichal clothes the lev as above, it is possible that the chitzonim (externals [evil forces]) attach, G-d forbid, to the yetzer (inclination) of the machshavos (thoughts) of the lev of this kosher . Advice on this, that he should appoint malachei libo (angels of his heart) , which is the aspect of his&#8217;lahavus halev (flaming of the heart) , that the his&#8217;lahavus is the aspect of malachim (angels) , in the aspect of: " And the malach of Hashem appeared unto him in a labas eish [flame of fire] " [Exodus 3:2]. And this eish (fire) burns them. And then also the heichal hakodesh receives the koach (power) of the eish and burns the klipos also from attaching to him, in the aspect of: " And the kavod of Hashem like a eish ocheles [devouring fire] " [Exodus 24:17]. 2. And the eish (fire) of this malach (angel) is made from the aspect of mishpat (judgment) that he sustains his devarim (words) in mishpat , that man judges himself: " For by eish will Hashem contend " [Isaiah 66:16]. " And Aharon shall bear the mishpat of Bnei Yisrael upon his lev [heart] continually " [Exodus 28:30]. And then mishpat comes forth to light, which is that the lev is flamed. And sits on a kisei (throne) in the aspect of: " He hath established His kisei for mishpat " [Psalms 9:8], which is the aspect of kavod (glory) above, in the aspect of: " A kisei kavod [throne of glory] " [Jeremiah 17:12]: " Uphold my ashurai [goings] in Thy maagalos [paths] " [Psalms 17:5], ashurai , this is the aspect of raglayim (feet) above in Thy maagalos , this is the aspect of kisei kavod , the aspect of: " And a rosh agol [round head] to the kisei from behind " [1 Kings 10:19], which is, that the kavod clothes the lev as above. And this is the aspect of: " A kiryah ne&#8217;emanah [faithful city] full of mishpat " [Isaiah 1:26], kiryah (city) , this is the aspect of Jerusalem, the ir hakodesh (holy city) above, clothes the mishpat above. And this is the aspect of: " At that time they shall call Jerusalem the kisei of Hashem; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of Hashem... neither shall they walk any more after the sherirus [stubbornness] of their lev ra [evil heart] " [Jeremiah 3:17], for the eish of the malachim in the lev above will subdue their lev ra . 3. And this is the aspect of shemiras Shabbos (guarding Shabbat) , as brought in the Zohar [Introduction 5b], " My Shabbasos ye shall keep ", My Shabbasos , this is igula (circle) and ribua (square) within. Igula , the aspect of kisei kavod (throne of glory) above, the aspect of: " And a rosh agol [round head] to the kisei ". And ribua , this is mishpat (judgment) , in the aspect of: " It shall be rabua [square] and kafool [double] " [Exodus 28:16], said about the choshen hamishpat (breastplate of judgment) . For on a weekday the Shechinah (Divine Presence) clarifies berurim (clarifications) , and on Shabbat she rests. And in the future when all ra (evil) will be nullified, in the aspect of " And they shall not walk any more in the sherirus of their lev ra ", then it will be a yom shekulo Shabbos (day that is all Shabbat) . Similarly, through igula and ribua above, through them ra is nullified as above, through this is formed the aspect of My Shabbasos , the aspect of igula and ribua . 4. And this is the aspect of: bitul (nullification) of the isur (prohibition) in shishim (sixty) . Shishim , this is the aspect of igula , the aspect of samech , which is igula , the aspect of kisei kavod , the aspect of: " And melachim [kings] to the kisei " [Job 36:7], the aspect of: " Shishim [threescore] are the melachos [queens] " [Song of Songs 6:8]. And the isur , which is the klipah (shell) , is nullified through kis&#8217;os lemishpat (thrones for judgment) . And one remembers only igula , for this is in isgalya (revealed) and ribua is covered in igula . And the main koach (power) of the samech is only from ribua , which is from the mem in the aspect of: " Forty stripes he may give him " [Deuteronomy 25:3]. For the samech receives from the mem , which is kis&#8217;os lemishpat . And this is the interpretation [Shabbat 104a]: Mem and samech in the luchos (tablets) stood by nes (miracle) . Mem , this is ribua , and samech , this is igula above, which in the luchos halev (tablets of the heart) , as it is written: " Write them upon the luach [tablet] of thy lev " [Proverbs 3:3], by nes they stand, by nes , this is the aspect o

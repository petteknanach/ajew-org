would not have been forgotten from Israel, and therefore lacking vav
from Tammuz as above because after the tablets were broken the vav
departed because the tablets are aspects of vav as our Rabbis, their
memory for blessing, said (Bava Basra 14) the tablets their length
six and their width six also the time of the giving of our Torah

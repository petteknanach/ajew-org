FREEDOM - LIBERTY - EMANCIPATION Tuesday, July 22, 2025 Likutay Moharan - Torah-teaching 62 62 - Through the Eating of Israel, Unity is Made (Yichud - Unification of the Holy One and His Shechinah) [Language of our Rabbi, his memory for blessing] And G-d turned the people [and so on] [Exodus 13:18] [See this Torah in another version from the manuscript of our Rabbi, of blessed memory, himself] 1. Know that through the eating of Israel, unity (yichud) of the Holy One, blessed be He, and His Shechinah (Kudsha Brich Hu u&#8217;Shechinteh - the masculine and feminine aspects of G-d in Kabbalah) face to face is made, in the aspect of And Boaz said to Ruth, at the time of the meal, come hither [Ruth 2:14], at the time of the meal specifically, that is, through the eating, come hither , this is the unity of the Holy One, blessed be He, and His Shechinah , aspect of And Judah approached him [Genesis 44:18], this is the approach of the king to the king ( Zohar , Vayigash, page 206, and see there in the explanation of the Ramaz) [Wordplay: Vayigash (approached, from root gash - to draw near) links to unity ] . Only the eating needs to be from food that is clarified (birur - purified) , and there is no mixture in it, for food that has mixture, through such food, the person can sin. 2. And the clarification of the foods is through faith (emuna) , for the truth, what Hashem, blessed be He, limited to the human intellect that he can understand, it is a great mitzvah (commandment) to sharpen the intellect, to understand the thing clearly, and on this it is said ( Avot , chapter 2): And know what to answer to an epicure (apikorus - heretic, doubter) , for there is a difference between the difficulties, for there is a difficulty that the person can understand an answer to this difficulty, on this it is said: And know what [and so on] , and there is a difficulty that it is not possible for the human intellect to understand an answer to such a difficulty, only in the future to come the answer will be revealed. It is forbidden for a person to look into them, and anyone who relies on his intellect and looks into it, on this it is said: All who come to her shall not return [Proverbs 2:19], for on such a difficulty, it is forbidden to rely on his intellect, only to establish on faith . And even these difficulties that have answers, sometimes the paths of the intellect are closed, and he does not know to answer, and epicureanism (apikorsus) is thrown into him, and he does not know what to answer to epicureanism . And this epicureanism is for each one according to his aspect, he can understand between great and small, for one needs to serve G-d with both inclinations, that the evil inclination be subdued to the good inclination, as the saying of our sages, may their memory be for blessing ( Berachot 54a): And you shall love [and so on] with all your heart , with your two inclinations, that his heart be complete with Hashem his G-d, that there not be controversy (machlokas - dispute, from root chalak - to divide) between two inclinations, that is, that his heart not be divided upon him, aspect of Their heart is divided [Hosea 10:2]. And in truth, if the person knew knowledge with a complete heart, that the whole earth is full of His glory [Isaiah 6:3], and the Holy One, blessed be He, stands at the time of prayer and hears the prayer, certainly he would pray with great fervor (hisla&#8217;havus - burning enthusiasm) , and would be very precise to direct his words. And because the person does not know this knowledge with a complete heart, because of this he does not [have such] fervor , and does not [have such] precision. And each one according to the smallness of his intellect and his knowledge, so his fervor and precision. And the knowledge is from the good inclination in the heart, and the hiding of the knowledge is from the evil inclination in the heart. And the hiding of the knowledge, they are epicureanism and difficulties, that the evil inclination hardens his heart to fall into evil [Proverbs 28:14]. And the repair for this controversy in the heart, to repair it in its root, that is, for the main formation of the controversy of the evil inclination, its root is from the controversy in holiness , when it descended from level to level until it descended below, was formed from it controversy of the evil inclination, aspect of Their heart is divided . And [it] throws into him epicureanism and hides from him the paths of the intellect, that he does not know to answer. And controversy in holiness is the controversy of Tannaim and Amoraim in the Gemara, that this forbids and this permits, and from their descent below, was formed from it controversy of the evil inclination. And when he repairs the controversy in holiness , then automatically the controversy of the evil inclination is nullified, for its hold is only from there. And repair of the controversy in holiness , they are decided halachos (rulings) , for decision of halacha is peace (shalom) and decision of controversy of the Tannaim and Amoraim. And through study of the poskim (decisors of Jewish law) , he is connected to the peace in holiness, and repairs the controversy in holiness , and then the controversy of the evil inclination in his heart is nullified. And then he can serve Hashem with all his heart, with two inclinations, and the gates of the intellect are opened to him, that he knows to answer to an epicure . And all this is made through the decision and the peace above. And these letters shalom , acronym sh et a ns l e&#8217;apikoros o m [ and know what to answer to an epicure ] [Acronym: Shalom (ש&#1473;&#1464;לו&#1465;ם) forms the initials of the Mishnah&#8217;s phrase, linking peace to resolving doubts] , for through the peace , he knows to answer to epicureanism in his heart. And this: I thank You with uprightness of heart, when I learn Your righteous judgments [Psalms 119:7], heart specifically, with two inclinations, when? When I learn Your righteous judgments , that is, through study of the poskim . But the difficulties that have no answer, it is forbidden for a person to look into them, only to strengthen himself in faith . And when he has faith in completeness, he can be, through his eating, unity of the Holy One, blessed be He, and His Shechinah , as above: And pasture faith [Psalms 37:3], that is, the aspect of eating through faith . 3. And the main completeness and adornments of faith , that is to bring close specifically the distant, aspect of To call all of them in the name of Hashem [Zephaniah 3:9], even idolaters will bring close to the faith of Israel, and to serve Him shoulder to shoulder. 4. And to complete the faith , that is, to bring close the distant, as above, needs first to raise the sparks (nitzotzos - holy fragments in Kabbalah, from shattered vessels) of letters of speech. And when the letters of speech are clarified , then the speech turns itself and gathers the sparks of holiness from between the klipos (shells - husks of impurity) , and the klipos remain without vitality. And then the idolaters, whose suckling is from the klipos , when they see that they have no vitality, then they cast their faith , aspect of In that day a man shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold [Isaiah 2:20], and attach themselves to the faith of Israel (there in Zephaniah): Then will I turn to the peoples a pure language , pure language , that is, the speech that was clarified from among them, it turns itself to the peoples, to gather</p>

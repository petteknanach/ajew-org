When he arouses his spirit to return to Him, it is very difficult for
him to pray and to speak words before Him, for they surround him from
every side, each according to his matter, as above. Because it is
impossible for him to bring forth speech before G-d with awe, love,
and proper vitality, therefore all the words and prayers that he
speaks cannot break through the partitions and screens that separate
them from ascending upward. They remain below, under the screens,
until he merits and returns in truth, speaking words that are fitting
to be accepted with awe and love from the depth of the heart, with
great arousal. Then, the illuminating word breaks through all the

<font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">But
how can he merit this? The main thing is that everything depends on
truth, to walk in the way of truth according to his level, for the
seal of the Holy One, blessed be He, is truth [Shabbat 55a, Yoma
69b], and it is the foundation of everything, for truth is beginning,
middle, end. Since he is at the level of truth, then, as if the light
of the Name, blessed be He, Himself—whose seal is truth—clothes
itself in him. Then it is said about him: &quot;Hashem is my light
and my salvation&quot; [Psalms 27]. Since Hashem is light for him, he
can find many openings to exit from the darkness and the exile where
he is closed there, for in truth there are many openings there, as
our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said [Yoma 38b, Menachot 29b]: One who
comes to become impure, they open for him; he has many openings (see
Shabbat 104a, Tosafot s.v. eit). Since openings are found there, he
could exit, but &quot;The fool walks in darkness&quot; [Ecclesiastes
2], and does not see the openings to exit. He is bound and tied
there, and they do not allow him to exit until he merits to speak
words of truth before Hashem. Then the words illuminate, and Hashem
is light for him, as above. Then: &quot;The opening of Your words
illuminates, giving understanding to the simple&quot; [Psalms 119],
for the illuminating words—that is, words of truth as above—show
him the opening. This is what it concludes: giving understanding to
the simple, for the simple who are placed in darkness and do not see
to exit, will understand and see the opening to exit from the
darkness, as it is written [Isaiah 49]: &quot;Saying to the
prisoners, 'Go out,' to those who are in darkness, 'Show
yourselves.'&quot;</font></font></font></p>

the truth needs to be complete truth, clear and pure, without any
blemish. The intelligent one who understands should pray all his days
that he merit once in all the days of his life to speak one word of
truth before Hashem as is fitting. There are several levels in this.
One who merits aspects of true truth, then Hashem is light for him,
and then he illuminates himself, for the light of Hashem clothes
itself in him. But one who has not yet reached the supernal level of
truth, and nevertheless he is at the level of truth—even though he
does not illuminate himself, since he has not reached the correct
truth—nevertheless, the truth helps so that another can illuminate
through him. In this also, there are levels and matters; the
intelligent one will understand them himself.</font></font></font></p>

[Rashi explains: which is open from below] that anyone who wants to
exit may exit [Rashi explains: anyone who wants to exit from it to
bad culture exits]. What is the reason its leg is suspended? If he
repents, they bring him in [and Rashi explains: they bring him in,
through the upper opening between the leg that is inside to its
roof]. And let him enter through this [lower opening]? It does not
help the matter, etc. [and Rashi explains: and let him enter through
this lower opening through which he exited? It does not help the
matter, for one who comes to purify needs help because of the evil
inclination; therefore, they make for him help, an extra opening]. It
turns out explained here that it is impossible to exit from the
impurity and to return in repentance through the opening through
which he fell there, as explained well in the Gemara and Rashi's

matters in this. For if he merits to see the openings that are there,
he can exit through the openings of the fall of his fellow, for the
descent and fall of this one is the aspect of ascent of that one;
understand. That is, sometimes what is considered a fall and descent
for his fellow, who is at a higher level, is considered for him an
aspect of ascent, relative to his low level. Therefore, even though
it is impossible to ascend through the openings through which he
himself fell there—only through a higher opening, as explained in

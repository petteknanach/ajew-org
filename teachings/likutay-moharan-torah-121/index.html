<p><b>121 – "Behold, I Come; in the Scroll of the Book It Is Written about Me"</b></p>

<p>"Then I said, 'Behold, I come; in the scroll of the book it is written about me. To do Your will…'" (Psalms 40:8-9)</p>

<p>When a person reads and studies in a book—as he studies in every passage—he finds himself absorbing rebuke, recognizing his faults and lowliness wherever he delves. That is a clear indication that he yearns to do the will of the Holy One, blessed be He. Then he says,</p>

<p>"Behold, I come; in the scroll of the book it is written about me": this is the sign of a heart desirous of doing Your will, my G-d.</p>

He went and got involved with<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>doctors, so that his kingdom should not be turned over to strangers,<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>but they did not help him. So he decreed on the Jews to pray for him<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>to have children. The Jews sought a tzadik to pray and bring about<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>that the King should have children. They sought and found a hidden<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>tzadik, and they told him to pray for the king to have children. He<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>replied: he knows nothing at all; they informed the king (inasmuch as<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>there was a hidden tzadik there, but he said he knew nothing). The<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>king sent a royal order for him, and they brought him before the<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>king. The king began talking kindly with him, "You know very<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>well that the Jews are in my hands. I can do with them what I will.<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>Therefore I ask you with goodness, pray that I have children."<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>The tzadik ensured the king that the same year he would have a child,<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>and he went home. The queen bore a daughter, and this princess was<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>extremely beautiful. When she was four years old, she knew all the<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>wisdoms and languages, and could play musical instruments. Kings from<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>all the countries would travel to see her, and it was a great joy for<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>the king.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>Afterwards,<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>the King very much wanted to have a son so that his kingdom should<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>not pass on to a stranger, so he decreed again on the Jews that they<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>should pray for him to have a son. They searched for the first<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>tzaddik, but they could not find him, for he had already passed away.<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>They continued searching and they found another hidden tzaddik. And<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>they told him that he should give the King a son, and he said that he<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>does not know anything. So they informed the king, and the king said<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>to the tzaddik also as before, "You know very well the Jews are<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>in my hands, etc." The sage (i.e. this tzadik) said to him, "But<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>will you be able to do what I order?" The king said, "Yes."<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>The sage said to him, "I need you to bring all the types of<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>gemstones (lit. good stones), because each gemstone has in it a<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>different segulah (ability, charm)." And by the kings<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>there is a book which documents all types of gemstones. The king<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>said, "I will spend half of my kingdom in order to have a son."<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>And the king went and brought him all the types of gemstones. The<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>sage took them, and ground them, and took a goblet of wine and poured<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>them in the wine. And he gave half of the cup of wine to the king to<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>drink, and the other half to the queen. And he told them that they<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>would have a son who would be thoroughly composed of gemstones, and<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>he would have in him all of the segulos of all of the<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>gemstones, and he went home. The queen gave birth to a son, and the<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>king rejoiced very greatly, but the son that was born was not made of<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>gemstones. When the son was four years old, he was extremely<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>handsome, very wise in all the wisdoms, and knew all the languages.<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>Kings traveled to see him. The princess saw that she was no longer so<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>important, and she was jealous of him. Her only consolation was that<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>the tzaddik had said that he would be completely of gemstones; it was<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>good that at least he was not made of gemstones.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>Once,<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>the prince was carving wood and he nicked his finger. The princess<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>ran to bandage his finger and she saw a gemstone there. She was<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>extremely jealous of him, and she made herself sick. Many doctors<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>came but were unable to heal her at all. Sorcerers were called. There<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>was a sorcerer there, to whom she disclosed the truth, that she had<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>made herself sick because of her brother, as mentioned. And she asked<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>the sorcerer if it was possible to perform a spell on a man to make<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>him leprous. He said, "Yes." She said to the sorcerer,<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>"What if he asks another sorcerer to annul the spell so that he<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>will be healed?" the sorcerer said, "If the sorcery is<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>thrown into the water, it can no longer be annulled." She did<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>so, and threw the sorcery into the water. The prince became very<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>leprous. He had leprosy on his nose, on his face, and on the rest of<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>his body. The King got involved with doctors and with sorcerers, but<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>they were of no avail. So the king decreed on the Jews to pray. The<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>Jews sought the tzaddik (who had prayed for the king to have a son,<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>as mentioned), and brought him before the king. Now, this tzaddik<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>would always pray before Hashem Yisburach, inasmuch as he had<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>promised the king that his son would be completely made of gemstones,<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>and it had not been fulfilled. And he complained to the Eibishter<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>(the Most High; G-d), "Have I done this for the sake of honor? I<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>have done this only for Your honor, and now, it has not been<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>fulfilled the way I said." And the tzadik came to the king. The<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>tzaddik prayed (namely, for the leprosy of the prince to be healed),<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>but to no avail. He was informed that it was sorcery.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>Now,<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>this tzaddik was higher than all sorcery. The tzaddik came and<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>informed the king that it was sorcery, and that the sorcery had been<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>thrown into the water, so the prince could not be healed except by<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>throwing the sorcerer who performed the spell into the water. The<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>king said, "I give you all the sorcerers to throw into the water<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>so that my son will be healed." The princess was afraid, so she<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>went to the water to pull the sorcery out of the water, for she knew<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>where it was. She fell into the water. A great tumult erupted over<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>the princess's falling into the water. The tzadik came and said that<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>the prince would be healed. And he was healed, the leprosy withered<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>up and fell off, and his entire skin peeled off. And he was entirely<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>of gemstones, as the tzaddik had said.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>[See<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>Conversations of Rabbi Nachman item # 147 regarding the events<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>surrounding this story which suggests that this story houses the<br data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>secret of the Divine Name of 42 letters].</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>Na Nach Nachma Nachman MeUman!</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>Rabbi Nachman's Legendary Tales</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-luswd2n2><em data-astro-cid-luswd2n2>Content continues in original source...</em></p> </div> </div> </section>

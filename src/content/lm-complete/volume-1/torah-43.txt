FREEDOM - LIBERTY - EMANCIPATION Wednesday, August 27, 2025 Likutay Moharan - Torah-teaching 43 Likutay Moharan Volume 1: Torah 43 Likutay Moharan Volume 1: Torah 43 &#8220;The diburim (speeches [teachings]) of the wicked produce ni&#8217;uf (licentiousness [degenerate spiritual or physical connection]) in the hearer&#8221; [In the language of our master, Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, of blessed memory] Know that the diburim (speeches) of the rosha (wicked person [evil individual]), who is a bar da&#8217;as (man of knowledge [intellectual acumen]), produce ni&#8217;uf (licentiousness) in the hearer. For zivugim (matings [spiritual or physical unions]) are drawn from da&#8217;as (knowledge [spiritual awareness]), as it is written: &#8220;And the man knew Chavah his wife&#8221; [Genesis 4:1]. And it is written: &#8220;Every woman who has known a man&#8221; [Numbers 31:17]. But there are two kinds of zivugim (matings): that is, zivug dikdushah (mating of holiness [connection to sanctity]), which is hiskashrus (attachment [connection]) to tzadikim, and to the Torah, and to Hashem, blessed be He&#8212;this is drawn from da&#8217;as dikdushah (knowledge of holiness). And zivugim (matings) of aveirah (transgression [sin]) are drawn from da&#8217;as diklipah (knowledge of the husk [evil force]). And dibbur (speech) is the hisgalus (revelation [expression]) of da&#8217;as (knowledge), for one does not know what is in the da&#8217;as (knowledge) except through dibbur (speech), as it is written: &#8220;And night to night yechaveh (declares) da&#8217;as (knowledge)&#8221; [Psalms 19:3] [root D-A ]. Yechaveh (declares) is from the language of dibbur (speech), meaning that dibbur (speech) speaks what is in the da&#8217;as (knowledge). And when a rosha (wicked person) speaks and brings out from his mouth vanities, he produces avirim arsim (poisonous airs [corrupting influences]) of ni&#8217;uf (licentiousness). And the hearer, from him, inhales these diburim (speeches) and breathes these neshimos (breaths [spiritual influences]), inserting these avirim (airs) into his body. And therefore, by Bil&#8217;am, who is an aspect of da&#8217;as diklipah (knowledge of the husk), as our chachamim (sages), of blessed memory, expounded [Sifri, Parshas Vezos Haberochoh; Zohar Shemos 21b, Balak 193b] on the verse: &#8220;No one has arisen like Moshe&#8221; [Deuteronomy 34:10]: &#8220;In Yisrael no one has arisen, but among the nations has arisen.&#8221; And who was that? Bil&#8217;am [Vayikra Rabbah 9]. And therefore, when Moav took aitzah (counsel [advice]) from Midyan, they said to them: &#8220;His ko&#8217;ach (power [strength]) is only in the mouth&#8221; [referring to Moshe&#8217;s power, but also highlighting Bil&#8217;am&#8217;s similar power]. For the mouth is the hisgalus (revelation) of da&#8217;as (knowledge). Moav said: &#8220;Also we will come upon them with a man whose ko&#8217;ach (power) is in the mouth&#8221; [Rashi, Balak]. For he also possessed da&#8217;as diklipah (knowledge of the husk), as it is written: &#8220;This opposite this, G-d made&#8221; [Ecclesiastes 7:14] [implying a parallel between Moshe&#8217;s holiness and Bil&#8217;am&#8217;s negative power]. And it is written: &#8220;And knows the da&#8217;as (knowledge) of the Most High&#8221; [Numbers 24:16]. And our rabboseinu (rabbis), of blessed memory, expounded [Berachos 7a]: That he knew when the Holy One, blessed be He, is angry. For when da&#8217;as (knowledge) is not in yishuv (settlement [clarity]), then there is ka&#8217;as (anger [divine wrath]). As our rabboseinu (rabbis) said [Pesachim 66b]: &#8220;Anyone who is angry, his chochmah (wisdom [spiritual insight]) departs from him.&#8221; And therefore, when Moshe our master, peace be upon him, was angry at the officers of the army when they came from Midyan, the da&#8217;as (knowledge) departed from him. And Elazar needed to say the laws of immersion of vessels. And when the da&#8217;as (knowledge) is complete, then there is no ka&#8217;as (anger), as it is written: &#8220;They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, for the earth shall be full of de&#8217;ah (knowledge)&#8221; [Isaiah 11:9]. And Bil&#8217;am was looking into da&#8217;as diklipah (knowledge of the husk), which is the excesses of upper da&#8217;as (knowledge). And when it changes [i.e., when holiness is concealed], he knew that the Holy One, blessed be He, is in ka&#8217;as (anger). It emerges that Bil&#8217;am is da&#8217;as diklipah (knowledge of the husk), and through his diburim (speeches) he produced avirim arsim (poisonous airs) of ni&#8217;uf (licentiousness). This is why, when they came from the war of Midyan, it is written: &#8220;And Moshe was angry with the officers of the army, and he said, &#8216;Have you kept every female alive? hein heinah (behold, they were) through the d&#8217;var (word [speech]) of Bil&#8217;am&#8217;&#8221; [Numbers 31:14-16]&#8212; b&#8217;d&#8217;var dayka (through the word precisely) [i.e., through Bil&#8217;am&#8217;s corrupting speech]. And therefore, when they came from the wars of Midyan, it is written: &#8220;And the heads of the officers approached Moshe etc. and they said, &#8216;And we have brought near the offering of Hashem etc., to atone for our nafshos (souls [selves]) before Hashem&#8217;&#8221; [Numbers 31:48-50]. And our rabboseinu (rabbis), of blessed memory, expounded [Shabbas 64a]: &#8220;That thus they said, &#8216;Even though from the hands of aveirah (transgression) we came out, from the hands of hirhur (thought [evil influence]) we did not come out.&#8217;&#8221; Posted by NaaNaach at 4:26&#8239;AM Email This BlogThis!

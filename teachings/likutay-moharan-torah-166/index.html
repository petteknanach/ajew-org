<p><b>166 – When the World Is with the Tzadik, He Has Dominion</b></p>

<p>When the world is with the tzadik (righteous person), then he has dominion.</p>

<p>For Elisha is at times referred to as "the man of G-d", and at times simply as "Elisha."</p>

<p>And our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said (Zohar, Beshalach 44a):</p>

<p>"When the sons of the prophets were with him, he was called 'the man of G-d'. But when he was alone, he was referred to simply as 'Elisha.'"</p>

<p>[This teaches that the presence of others with the tzadik grants him stature and influence, while isolation diminishes how he is addressed, though not his essence.]</p>

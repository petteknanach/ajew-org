<font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">There
is a great difference in the transgression that a person commits, G-d
forbid, depending on whether he is aroused immediately and returns in
repentance right away. In such a case, it is possible for him to
return to his place easily, because when he commits a transgression,
G-d forbid, he deviates from the straight path to another corrupted
path. From that path emerge many straying and highly corrupted routes
and ways. When one begins to follow that evil path, G-d forbid, one
becomes lost and confused in those paths, making it difficult to
return and escape from there. However, Hashem, blessed be He, has the
way of calling the person immediately upon seeing that he is straying
from the path of intellect, urging him to turn back. He calls each
one according to their aspect: some with a hint, some with an actual
call, and some He kicks and strikes—this is their call. For the
Torah proclaims before them&nbsp;</font></font></font><font color="#0000ff"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>&quot;How
long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity&quot;</b></font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;[Proverbs
1], and the Torah is Hashem, blessed be He, Himself, who calls them
and seeks their return to Him. Therefore, when one has not yet
deviated much from the straight path, it is easy to return, as he
still recognizes the voice and is accustomed to it. This person was
recently close to Hashem, blessed be He, hearing His voice—the
voice of the Torah—and has not yet forgotten it, nor strayed far
into those other confusing and bewildering paths. Thus, return is
possible with ease. This is like the parable of a shepherd: when one
sheep strays from the path, he calls it immediately. If the sheep has
not strayed far, it recognizes the voice and follows it right away.
But if it has deviated greatly, it forgets the voice and no longer
recognizes it, and the shepherd also despairs of seeking it further,
as much time has passed since it wandered away. Similarly, when one
has prolonged their time in wickedness, G-d forbid, deviating far
from the straight path into those corrupted, straying, confusing, and
bewildering paths, return becomes difficult as mentioned above. Know
that in these corrupted and straying paths, when a person wanders in
them extensively, G-d forbid, it is sometimes possible that through
the very excess of wandering in those confusing paths, it turns
around, and he returns until he is very close to his original place.
Only a small distance remains between him and his initial position,
and with a minor trial, he can easily return to it. But when Hashem,
blessed be He, calls him and arranges the trial, he does not
recognize the voice and does not heed the return to his place. This
is the difference between a youth and an elder: one still in youth,
not yet aged in sins, can return more easily than the elder, as he
remains close and has not forgotten the calling voice. This is &quot;</font></font></font><font color="#ff0000"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">I

yet, and I still recognize the calling voice of the commandments,
which are the Torah. Thus, my plea is for mercy to seek me swiftly,
while I have not forgotten Your commandments—that is, while I still
recognize the calling voice of the Torah and commandments. For when a
person ages in sins, G-d forbid, it is very hard to seek him, as he
has forgotten the voice of the Torah and commandments and no longer
recognizes the call. Therefore, one must request from Hashem, blessed
be He, that He hasten to seek and return him while he has not
completely forgotten the voice of the Torah and commandments, as
above. This is what King David, peace be upon him, requested: &quot;</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><i>seek

as above (explaining the urgency of divine intervention before
complete forgetfulness sets in).</font></font></font></p>

      <p>And the utter enormity of the dangers that they had on their return is impossible to relate, because they were on this battleship which was full of Ishmaelites, and they were just two Jews alone. And the way of the Ishmaelites, especially men of war, is to grab Jews and sell them in distant places as slaves, and Rabbainu o.b.m. had great fear of this. And he (Rabbainu) said that he started to think to himself what he would do if they took him to some place on the sea where there is no Jew and they would sell him there, and who would know from this? And he was greatly distressed, how would he be able to fulfill there the Commandments of the Torah? And he began to contemplate this in his mind, until he merited to come to the hasaga (-conception, attainment) that he could serve Hashem Yisburach even when he would be unable Heaven forbid to fulfill the mitzvahs. Because he attained conception of the devotion of the Forefathers of the World that they had before the giving of the Torah, that they fulfilled all the mitzvos even though they did not do the mitzvos in their simple plain form, like our forefather Jacob who fulfilled the mitzva of Tefilin by means of the rods which he pealed, as is known (Zohar Va'yaitzay 162:), until he attained conception of how to fulfill all the mitzvos in this way when he would be incapacitated in the place where they would sell him Heaven forbid (see The Life of Our Leader Rabbi Nachman 142). And immediately when he merited to this conception, Hashem Yisburach helped him, and the boat came and arrived on Ohr (-the light, in this case referring to the night when we search for chumetz by candle light, see the beginning of Tractate Pesachim at length, and Likutay Moharan volume 2, Torah-teaching 83 why this specific night is called light) of the fourteenth of (the month of) Nissan (the day preceding Passover) at a large city that stands on an island in the sea, where there is a "prominent large city (Jonah 3:3)" by the name of Rhodes (-largest of the Dodecanese islands of Greece), and they recognized that this was a city of (-where there were) Israel (-Jews). And they had great joy, because they could buy here matzos for Passover and (wine for the) four cups. However, they did not conceive that the captain and the Ishmaelites would allow them to enter this city, because they saw and understood that the Ishmaelites desired to grab them and kidnap them, and possibly they themselves would sell them as mentioned above.</p>

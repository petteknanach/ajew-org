FREEDOM - LIBERTY - EMANCIPATION Tuesday, July 22, 2025 Likutay Moharan - Torah-teaching 63 Likutay Moharan, Torah 63 Likutay Moharan Torah 63: Sod Kavonas HaMila (Secret of the Kavana [-Kabbalistic Intentions] of the Circumcision) "Seraphim stood above Him, six wings, six wings to one; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew" [Isaiah 6:2] The secret of the kavana (kabbalistic intentions) of the circumcision, for bris (organ of circumcision, referring to the covenant of sexual purity) is called in the language of the Targum amah (cubit), as mentioned in this language in the Gemara (Shabbat 108b), and it is the aspect of amah of six handbreadths [ tefachim ] (Eruvin 3b) [ Wordplay: bris as amah ( אמה ) links the circumcised organ to measurement, symbolizing structure and holiness ], that the bris includes them, and it is the aspect of "Seraphim stood above Him, six wings, six wings to one" [Isaiah 6:2] (see Zohar Pinchas 246) [ Correlation: Six wings parallel six tefachim , symbolizing spiritual elevation ]. Six wings, they are the aspect of the six tefachim (handbreadths) above, "With two he covered his panim (face), and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew" [ Three pairs of wings correspond to three aspects of spiritual function: concealment, grounding, and elevation ], for panim is the aspect of and he slapped him on his face (Bava Kamma 32b) [ Root: (t-f-ch) ( טפח ) connects physical measurement to spiritual covering ], and with two he covered his panim , is the aspect of two tefachim , aspect of revealing a handbreadth and covering a handbreadth, as our Sages said, may their memory be for blessing (Nedarim 20a). Similarly, with two he covered his feet, is the aspect of and he slapped him with his sandal (Bava Kamma 32b), and it is also the aspect of two tefachim as above, revealing a handbreadth and covering a handbreadth, and with two he flew, is the aspect of birds [ ofot ], that were created from the mire (Chullin 27b), aspect of flapping to make fly (Yoma 78a, Gittin 16a, Avodah Zarah 50b) [ Wordplay: Root (t-f-ch) ( טפח ) ties flying to the bris &#8217;s spiritual elevation ]. And all the six tefachim , all are included and placed in the bris , for the six tefachim above are the aspect of "Six days in which Hashem made the heavens and the earth" in the aspect of "Behold, You have made my days handbreadths" [Psalms 39:6], as it is written "Six days Hashem made etc., and He rested on the seventh day" [Exodus 20:11], that is, all the six days, aspect of the six tefachim , He placed all of them on the seventh day, which is Shabbos, which is the aspect of bris , as it is written "An everlasting covenant between Me and the children of Israel" [Exodus 31:16] [ Correlation: Shabbos as bris links rest to covenantal holiness ]. This is the aspect of Bereishit Bara Shit ( ב&#1468;&#1456;ר&#1461;אש&#1473;&#1460;ית ב&#1468;&#1464;ר&#1464;א ש&#1473;&#1460;ית ) (In the beginning created six) (Tikkunei Zohar Tikkun 11), aspect of six days, six tefachim above, that all are placed and included in the bris , and this is Bereishit Brit Esh ( ב&#1468;&#1456;ר&#1461;אש&#1473;&#1460;ית ב&#1468;&#1456;ר&#1460;ית א&#1461;ש&#1473; ) (In the beginning covenant of fire) (Tikkunei Zohar Tikkun 3, page 18), that is, bris that is included from six days, six tefachim , six wings, and this is bris of fire, aspect of seraphim with six wings, which are the aspect of six tefachim as above. For also fire has six powers, and as explained also to the investigators, that there are six powers in fire, that is, melting and freezing, cooking and burning, blackening and whitening, and similarly a bird has six powers, for through flying it is hidden and revealed, near and far, etc. And the tzadik (righteous one), who is the aspect of bris (organ of circumcision, referring to the covenant of sexual purity), aspect of "The righteous is the foundation of the world" [Proverbs 10:25], he is included from the aspects of the six tefachim above, which are divided into three aspects of two by two, that is, each aspect from the three is the aspect of revealing a handbreadth and covering a handbreadth, for he is the aspect of revealing a handbreadth and covering a handbreadth against himself, and this is the aspect of: with two he covered his panim (face). Similarly, he is the aspect of revealing and covering against the world, and this is the aspect of with two he covered his feet, and similarly he is the aspect of revealing and covering against Hashem, and this is the aspect of with two he flew, for sometimes he is with the world, aspect of revealing, that he reveals and brings himself close to them, and sometimes he is the aspect of covering, that he is covered and hidden from them, that he distances himself greatly from them, and not only does he distance himself from them, and elevates himself above them, and they cannot come close to him, but questions [ kushyos ] and wonders [ t&#8217;michos ] fall upon him, until his mind is distorted and confused because he distanced himself greatly from them, and questions and wonders are difficult for him, and this is the aspect of: covering a handbreadth, and this is the aspect of with two he covered his feet, feet in the language of drawing, as "And all the people that are at your feet" [Exodus 11:8], those who go after your counsel (as brought in Rashi there), that is, in the drawing that he draws the world to him, it is the aspect of revealing a handbreadth and covering etc. as above. For because the mind of the tzadik in himself cannot be received from him, therefore he needs to cover and clothe himself in small things so that he can reveal, that the world can receive from him, and this is the aspect of: revealing a handbreadth and covering a handbreadth, that what he covers and clothes himself, is the aspect of revealing, that through this he reveals himself to them, for without this it was not possible to reveal to them, and sometimes he is the aspect of covering literally, that he is covered and hidden from them, and distanced and wondrous from them as above. Similarly with Hashem, it needs to be the aspect of revealing and covering, for he needs to attach and bring himself close to Hashem, as if, so to speak, Hashem is revealed and comes close to him, but the more he comes close to Hashem, he needs to distance more, that is, the more he comes close, he needs to know that he is very far from Hashem, for if he thinks and imagines in his mind that he has already come close to Hashem and knows the knowledge of Hashem, this is a sign that he knows nothing, for if he knew a little from Hashem, he would know that he is very far from Him, for the more he comes close to Hashem, and knows more, he knows that he is very far, and does not know at all, and this is a matter that it is impossible for the mouth to speak and explain, for the greatness of the Creator has no measure, and this is the aspect of "Peace to the far and to the near" [Isaiah 57:19], aspect of: revealing a handbreadth and covering, that the more he comes close, he distances as above. This is the aspect of with two he flew, flew, its Targum: serves [ m&#8217;shamesh ], that is the aspect of revealing a handbreadth and covering of the service, that he serves and worships Hashem as above. And with two he covered his panim , this is the aspect of revealing a handbreadth and covering a handbreadth with himself, "My face shall go" [Exodus 33:14] (see Berachot 7a), and also panim in </p>

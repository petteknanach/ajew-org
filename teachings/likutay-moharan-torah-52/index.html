And according to their evil, confused opinion, it seems to them that

custom of the world. But in truth, they open their mouths to
**vanity** [</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><i>hevel</i></font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">],

hametzi'ut</i></font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">].
For only Hashem, blessed be He, alone is an obligatory existence, but
all the worlds with all that is in them are a possible existence. For
He, blessed be He, created them *ex nihilo* [from nothing], and in
His ability, power, and possibility, blessed be He, it was to create
them or not to create them. Therefore, certainly, all the world and
its fullness are a possible existence. But from where is the error
drawn that they can err, G-d forbid, that the world is an obligatory
existence, G-d forbid? Know that this is drawn because in truth, now
that the souls of Israel were already emanated and drawn forth, now
certainly the world is in the aspect of an obligatory existence. For
certainly all the world and its fullness were not created except for
Israel, as is known (Vayikra Rabbah 36 and Rashi, beginning of
Bereishit). And Israel rules in the world. Therefore, certainly, now,
after the souls of Israel were emanated and created, as it were, He,
blessed be He, is compelled to create and sustain the world. For it
was on this condition that He emanated the souls of Israel, in order
to create all the worlds for their sake. But the souls of Israel
themselves, when they were emanated, they themselves, along with all
the worlds dependent upon them, all were a possible existence. For it
was in His possibility to emanate and create them or not to create
them. But immediately, when the Holy One, blessed be He, desired to
emanate the souls of Israel, then all the world was in the aspect of
an obligatory existence. For since the souls of Israel were emanated,
then, as it were, He is obligated to bring the world into existence.
For it was on this condition that their souls were emanated—that
all the worlds would be created for their sake, and they would rule
over everything. Understand well: from this was chained and drawn the
error of the heretics who say that the world is, G-d forbid, an
obligatory existence. But in truth, only Hashem, blessed be He, alone
is an obligatory existence, but all things are a possible existence,
as mentioned above. And the main intention that He created all the
world for Israel was so that Israel would do His will and return and
cleave to their **root** [</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><i>shoresh</i></font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">]
– that is, that they return and be included in Him, blessed be He,
who is an obligatory existence. And for this was everything created.
It turns out that the more Israel does the will of the Omnipresent
and is included in their root, which is an obligatory existence,
through this all the world, which was created for them, is included
in obligatory existence. For the main purpose for which the world was
created is for this. And only for this is Hashem, blessed be He,
compelled, as it were, to create and sustain all the worlds for the
sake of Israel, as mentioned above, so that they will do His will, as
mentioned above. And therefore, precisely then, when they do His
will, the world is included in the aspect of an obligatory existence,
as mentioned above. For the more they do His will, the more they are
included, along with all the worlds dependent upon them, in
obligatory existence. For through their doing His will, blessed be
He, they return and are included in Him, blessed be He, who is an
obligatory existence. And then all the worlds that depend on their
soul are included with them in obligatory existence, as mentioned
above. However, to merit this—to be included in one’s root, that
is, to return and be included in the unity of Hashem, blessed be He,
who is an obligatory existence—it is impossible to merit except
through **nullification** [</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><i>bittul</i></font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">],
that one nullifies his existence completely until he is included in
His unity, blessed be He. And it is impossible to come to
nullification except through **seclusion** [</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><i>hisbodidus</i></font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">].
For through secluding oneself and explaining one’s conversation
between oneself and one’s Creator, through this one merits to
nullify all desires and bad traits until one merits to nullify all
one’s physicality and to be included in one’s root. However, the
main seclusion is at night, at a time when the world is free from the
distractions of this world. For during the day, because people pursue
this world, it nullifies and confuses a person from cleaving and
being included in Hashem, blessed be He. And even if one is not
personally distracted, nevertheless, since the world is distracted
then and pursuing the vanities of this world then, it is difficult
then to come to nullification. And also, the seclusion needs to be in
a special place, that is, outside the city, on a solitary road, in a
place where people do not go there. For in a place where people go
during the day, who pursue this world, even if they are not going
there at the moment, it also confuses the seclusion, and one cannot
nullify oneself and be included in Him, blessed be He. Therefore, one
needs to go alone at night on a solitary road, in a place where there
are no people. And there one shall go and seclude oneself and clear
one’s heart and mind from all the affairs of this world and nullify
everything until one merits to the aspect of true nullification. That
is, initially, he should increase in prayers and conversations in
seclusion at night on a solitary road, as mentioned above, until he
merits to nullify this thing, that is, to nullify this trait and
desire. And afterwards, he should increase yet more in the
aforementioned seclusion until he nullifies another trait and desire.
And he should continue in this manner for a long time in seclusion,
at the aforementioned time and in the aforementioned place, until he
nullifies everything. And afterwards, there still remains something
from him, etc., and afterwards, they nullify this also, until nothing
remains of him. [Explanation: For it is possible that after one has
nullified all desires and bad traits, something still remains of him,
that is, he has not yet completely nullified pride and arrogance, so
that he is still considered something in his own eyes. Therefore, one
needs to toil and increase in the aforementioned seclusion until
nothing remains of him, so that he will be in the aspect of &quot;what&quot;
[</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><i>mah</i></font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">]
in truth, until he merits to the aspect of true nullification.] And
then, when one merits to true nullification, and then his soul is
included in its root, that is, in Him, blessed be He, who is an
obligatory existence, then all the world along with his soul is
included in its root, which is an obligatory existence. For
everything is dependent on Him, as mentioned above. And then all the
world is made through him into the aspect of obligatory existence, as
mentioned above. And now you shall see wonders of wonders, how all
this is explained now in the aforementioned Mishnah. Explain well:
&quot;One who stays awake at night&quot; literally, that is, that he
is awake at night and secludes himself, and explains his conversation
between him and his Creator. And &quot;who walks on the road alone,&quot;
that is, as mentioned above, that he walks on a solitary road
precisely, in a place where people do not go, as mentioned above. For
then it is the main completeness of the seclusion: at night and on a
solitary road precisely, as mentioned above. For then precisely they
can come to the aspect of nullification, as mentioned above. And
&quot;turns his heart to vanity&quot; – that is, that he turns his
heart from all affairs of this world to vanity, so as to merit to the
aspect of nullification, as mentioned above. And then he merits that
his soul be included in the obligatory existence, as mentioned above.
And then all the worlds with his soul are included in the obligatory
existence, as mentioned above. &quot;Behold this one is liable for
his soul&quot; – that all the world is included in the aspect of
obligatory existence with his soul. For through the aforementioned
seclusion, he merited to the aspect of nullification, until his soul
is included in obligatory existence. And through this, all the world
with his soul is included in obligatory existence, as mentioned
above. And his soul and all the world are made into the aspect of
obligatory existence, as mentioned above. And this is: &quot;behold
this one is liable for his soul,&quot; as mentioned above. [And here
is to you the language of our master, of blessed memory, from this
Torah, which he wrote in the utmost brevity:] &quot;who walks on the
solitary road, who stays awake at night, etc.&quot; Know that the
main nullification – that a person nullifies his existence and
becomes nothing and is included in the unity of Hashem, blessed be He
– this is only through seclusion. And seclusion needs a special
place and time, so that the preventers do not confuse him. And the
time is at night – that is, &quot;who stays awake at night&quot; –
for then all are sleeping. And the place is on a solitary road, and
not on the public road, so that passersby do not interrupt him. But
precisely on a road where the many do not go, there he shall go and
seclude himself. And that is: &quot;and who walks on the solitary
road.&quot; And then he can clear his heart from everything, and can
come to nullification of all existence. And that is: &quot;and who
turns his heart to vanity.&quot; And then, when he is nullified
completely, then he is included in the unity of Hashem, blessed be
He. And then he comes to the aspect of obligatory, for the Holy One,
blessed be He, is obligatory existence, and all things are a possible
existence. And when he is nullified and included in His unity, then
he comes out from the aspect of possible and is included in the
obligatory. And this is the aspect of: &quot;behold this one is
liable for his soul.&quot;</font></font></font></p>

- Rectification for Nocturnal Emission</b></span></font></font></font></span></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; background: #ffffff">
<font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Rectification
for nocturnal emission, may the Merciful One save us, is to recite
ten chapters of Psalms on that very day that it occurred to him, God
forbid, because there is power in reciting Psalms to extract the drop
from the shell&nbsp;that took it. For Psalms [Tehilim] numerically
equals Lilith, including the five letters of her name, as she is
appointed over this, as is known. And one must intend during the
recitation of Psalms, that Psalms [Tehilim] numerically equals 485,
which is aligned with the number of the two Names E-l E-lohim in
their full expansion like this: Aleph Lamed Aleph Lamed Hei Yud Mem.
Through these two Names, the drop emerges from the shell, because the
drop is an aspect of kindness and strength, as is known, for it
contains the power of fire and water, warmth and moisture, which are
aspects of kindness and strength. And through these two Names E-l
E-lohim mentioned above, which are aspects of kindness and strength,
as is known, and which numerically equal Psalms as mentioned above,
through this, they extract the drop from there. And this is what one
must intend during the recitation of Psalms. And therefore, one must
recite ten chapters, because there are ten types of song, which are
aspects of the ten expressions (-literary styles) that are expressed
in the Book of Psalms, as brought (in the Gemara Pesachim 117a and in
the Zohar). They are Ashrei, Lamnatzeach, Maskil, Halleluyah, and so
on (see in the commentary of Rashi). And there is power in each and
every tongue of these ten tongues mentioned above to nullify the
power of the shell mentioned above, because each one of these tongues
is the opposite of the shell mentioned above. For Ashrei is a tongue
of seeing and contemplation, the opposite of the shell mentioned
above, whose main power comes from the spoiling of sight, from the
aspect of &quot;and his eyes dimmed from seeing,&quot; in the aspect
of &quot;let there be darkness&quot; missing, and our Rabbis, of
blessed memory, expounded (Tikunei Zohar Tikun 44, page 79b): this is
Lilith. It is found that her main power is from the spoiling of
seeing, and Ashrei, which is an expression of seeing, is the opposite
of her. And similarly, Maskil, because she is an aspect of meshakel
(causing miscarriage), and Maskil is the opposite of this. And
regarding this matter, see elsewhere [above in sign 19], because her
main power to cause a person to sin with emission, God forbid, is
through the tongue of Targum, which is an aspect of Maskil through
the interpreter, who mixes good and evil, sometimes meshakel and
sometimes maskil; see there. And similarly, Halleluyah is the
opposite of the shell, whose name is Lilith because she howls in
howling always, and Hallel is the opposite of yelalah, for the
letters of Halleli are the opposite of yelalah. And the rest he did
not explain.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Also,
the drop comes from the knowledge, which is an aspect of kindness and
strength, as is known, because the drop is also an aspect of kindness
and strength, as mentioned above. And it is known that the knowledge
is an aspect of five kindnesses and five strengths; therefore, one
must recite ten chapters. And this is the aspect of (Psalms 32): &quot;To
David Maskil, happy is he whose transgression is forgiven&quot; –
the initials form Na'af (adultery), which is subdued through the
aspect of &quot;to David Maskil,&quot; that is, Psalms.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Afterward,
our Rabbi, of blessed memory, revealed the ten chapters of Psalms
specifically that one must recite them on that day that it happens to
him, God forbid, an unclean emission. And these are: Mikhtam to
David, 16; To David Maskil, 32; Happy is he who considers the poor,
41; As the deer pants, 42; To the conductor do not destroy, 59; To
the conductor on Yedutun, 77; Prayer of Moses, 90; Give thanks to
Hashem call on His name, 105; By the rivers of Babylon, 137;
Halleluyah praise God in His sanctuary, 150. And he said: that these
ten chapters of Psalms are a very, very great rectification for
emission, God forbid. And whoever merits to recite them on that day
need not fear anymore at all from the awesome damage of the emission,
God forbid, because certainly it is rectified through this [and see
this matter in Likutei Moharan, second part, at its end].</font></font></font></p>

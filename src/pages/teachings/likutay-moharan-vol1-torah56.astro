FREEDOM - LIBERTY - EMANCIPATION Tuesday, July 22, 2025 Likutay Moharan - Torah-teaching 56 Likutay Moharan 56 - And on the Day of the First Fruits Likutay Moharan 56 - And on the Day of the First Fruits And on the day of the bikurim (first fruits), when you bring near a new offering to Hashem in your Shavuos (Feast of Weeks), it shall be a holy convocation for you; all labor of service you shall not do ( Numbers 28:26 ). 1. For there is in every one of Israel an aspect of malchus (kingship), and each one according to his aspect, so he has aspects of malchus . There is one who rules in his house, and there is one who governs more, and so there is one who governs over the entire world, each one according to the aspect of malchus that he has, in the aspects: "Officers of thousands, and officers of hundreds, and officers of fifties, and officers of tens" ( Exodus 18:21 ). And these aspects of malchus that are in every one are in isgalya (revealed) and in iskasya (concealed). In isgalya , that is, the governance that each one has according to his aspect, that he governs over those people in isgalya according to the aspect of his malchus as mentioned above. And in iskasya , it is that also each one according to his aspect has an aspect of malchus in iskasya , that is, even though in isgalya it appears that he has no governance over those people, nevertheless in iskasya and in great concealment, he governs over those people because their souls are under him, and they submit under him. And also this aspect of malchus in iskasya is for each one according to his aspect, in the aspect: "Officers of thousands, and officers of hundreds" and so forth. And there is one who in isgalya has no governance at all, and even so in iskasya and in great concealment, he governs over the entire generation and even over all the tzadikim (righteous ones) of the generation, because all their souls are all under his governance and malchus , and they all submit and bow to him, only that it is in great concealment, in the aspects: "In every place it is offered and presented to My name" ( Malachi 1:11 ), that even though they serve idolatrous worship, nevertheless in great concealment they all submit to Him, blessed is He, and serve Him, blessed is He, only that it is in great concealment. So too this aspect of malchus in iskasya , that even though in isgalya he has no governance at all, nevertheless in great concealment, he reigns over them, and they are all under him and submit to him. 2. And each one needs to not use the aspects of malchus that he has for his enjoyment and his needs, that the aspects of malchus should not be with him as a servant to fulfill his desire, but rather the aspect of malchus should be in the aspect of a free son, "Happy are you, O land, when your king is a free son" ( Ecclesiastes 10:17 ), that the malchus should be with you a free son, to not use it for your enjoyment. And this is the aspect of Mordechai , the aspect of mar dror (pure myrrh) ( Chullin 139b ), that the marus (bitterness, [root: מרר ]), that is, the malchus , has dror (freedom) and liberty to not use it for his enjoyment and his needs, but only for Hashem, blessed is He, in the aspects: "And the kingdom shall be to Hashem" ( Obadiah 1:21 ), that is, to use the malchus for the service of Hashem, blessed is He, that is, to warn and to reprove all the souls that submit to him, each one according to the aspects of malchus that he has in isgalya and in iskasya . Whether he governs in his house, he needs to warn and reprove the members of his household, and if he has more governance, it is incumbent upon him to warn more and more people according to the aspect of his malchus . 3. And one needs to draw longevity of days into the malchus so that it should not be in the aspects: "The leadership buries its possessors" ( Pesachim 87b ), because each one according to the aspect of malchus that he has is in the aspect of a tzofeh (watchman) who is obligated to warn and reprove the people who are from his root, over whom he has an aspect of malchus . And if he warns and reproves them, then he does his part and saves his soul, as it is stated: "I have appointed you a watchman for the house of Israel... and you, if you have warned the wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness... he shall die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your soul" ( Ezekiel 3:17-19 ). But if he does not warn and reprove them, then the punishment is upon him [ as it is written there ]. And therefore, the leadership buries its possessors. And therefore, one needs to see to draw longevity of days into the malchus , that is, that he should see that he is able to warn and reprove them. But how can he warn and reprove them when he does not know what they need, and also they are not with him to reprove them? And therefore, one needs for this daas (knowledge) in order to know how to reprove them. And to come to this daas is also through longevity of days itself. And this is what the world says, that he does not know from his life, because the main knowledge is from life, from longevity of days. Because to come to longevity of days is through engagement in Torah (teaching, [root: ירה ]), because oraysa (Torah) is the name of the Holy One, blessed is He ( Tikkunei Zohar, Tikkun 10, 25b ). And just as when one needs to call someone, they call him by his name, so too when one needs to call the Life of Lives in order to draw from Him life and longevity of days, one needs to call Him by His name, so to speak, and His name is the Torah as mentioned above. It follows that through engagement in Torah , one calls the longevity of days. And therefore, the king is cautioned regarding engagement in Torah more than the entire world because he needs to call the longevity of days into the malchus as mentioned above, "And it shall be with him, and he shall read in it all the days of his life, in order that he may prolong days over his kingdom" ( Deuteronomy 17:19 ). And this is "and he shall read in it all the days of his life" , " and he shall read " in it precisely, that is, through engagement in Torah he calls the life as mentioned above. And this is "the days of his life" , the days of his life precisely, because when one receives the vitality, one needs to receive it in measure, because without measure and constriction it is impossible to receive the vitality from Hashem, blessed is He, because of the abundance of light, for an abundance of oil causes the extinguishing of the lamp. Therefore, one needs to receive the vitality in measure, and this is achieved through engagement in Torah , because the Torah is the name of the Holy One, blessed is He, and the name is the vessel of the thing, that in this name the vitality of that thing is contained, "A living soul, it is its name" ( Genesis 2:7 ), that in the name the soul and vitality of every thing is contained. And therefore, when one calls a person by his name, he is immediately ready at hand because in the name all his soul and vitality is contained. And so the Torah is the name of the Holy One, blessed is He, that is, there the vitality from the Life of Lives is contained, because the Torah is the aspect of measures, for there are in the Torah letters and words and verses and portions and orders, which are the aspect of measures in which the vitality is contained in measure. And therefore, through the Torah , which is the name of the Holy One, blessed is He, which is the aspect of measures, one can receive the vitality, because throu</p>

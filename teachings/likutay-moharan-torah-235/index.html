that who goes and is divided and falls and then the world laugh from
him, and he is ashamed from this this comes by that he damaged in the
joy of festival because festival is called foot, and also is called
appointed time and by that he damaged in joy of festival, is made
from this foot appointed therefore his foot is appointed and he fell
and this the laughter that they laugh, it is aspects of the fallen
joys from damage of joy of festival and therefore he is ashamed
because idolatry is called shame, [Hosea 9] and who despises the
appointed times as if he worships idolatry (Pesachim 118) therefore
comes on him shame and sometimes it is to him for atonement and
sometimes it is not atoned for him in this only in order to remind
him that he should return.</font></font></font></p>

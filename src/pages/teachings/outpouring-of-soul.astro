      <h2>🙏 Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The <em>Outpouring of the Soul</em> (שפך נפשו) contains the essential teachings of Rabbi Nachman on prayer, hisbodidus (personal prayer), and serving Hashem. These teachings reveal the path to true closeness with God through heartfelt conversation and supplication.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rabbi Nachman emphasized that prayer is the key to everything - through prayer one can achieve Torah, service, holiness, and all the good of all the worlds.

      <h3>1. Hisbodidus - The Power of Personal Prayer</h3>
      <p>
        Hisbodidus is a great virtue, higher than everything. Namely, to set for himself, in any case, an hour or more to do hisbodidus alone by himself in any room or in the field, and to express his words between himself and his Creator, with arguments and reasoning, with words of charm, and endearment, and appeasement, to beseech and entreat before Him Blessed He.

      <h3>2. Prayer in Our Spoken Language</h3>
      <p>
        He should be very vigilant to accustom himself to be diligent with this every day... And this prayer and conversing should be in the spoken language, that is, in our country, in Yiddish (today this can very readily refer to English vernacular), for in the Holy Tongue it is difficult for him to express all he has to say, and also the heart is not drawn after the words.

      <h3>3. The Essence of Prayer</h3>
      <p>
        He said, that the essence of the prayer is the binding (divaikus) to Hashem Yisburach. And it would be better to pray in the Yiddish (English) that is spoken, because when one prays in the spoken language, then the heart is very close and attached to the words of the prayer.

      <h3>4. Original Prayer - A New Path</h3>
      <p>
        He said regarding the eminence of conversing between oneself and his Maker; for the prayers, and entreaties, and supplications that were already standardized, they are already known to all the destructive forces and prosecutors... But when going on a new path and road, which are still unknown, there they do not know to ambush at all.

      <h3>5. Through Prayer One Can Come to Everything</h3>
      <p>
        Someone asked him, in the matter of the conduct of drawing close to Hashem, and he instructed him to learn etc.. And he asked him, "but I am not able to learn." He answered him, "through prayer one can come to everything, to everything good: to Torah, and to service (of Hashem), and to all the holiness, and to all the devotions, and to all the good of all the worlds."

      <h3>6. Joy and Hisbodidus</h3>
      <p>
        When a person is happy the entire day, then he can readily designate an hour of the day to break his heart and converse everything that is on his heart, before Hashem... A broken heart and sadness are not at all the same thing. For a broken heart is of the heart, whereas sadness comes from the spleen, and it is the other (-evil) side, and the Holy One Blessed He hates it; however, a broken heart is cherished before Hashem.

      <h3>7. Speak to G-d Like a Child</h3>
      <p>
        It is very good for someone who is able, to pour out his words before Hashem piteously and pleadingly, like a son who yearns before his father, for behold Hashem already called us sons, as it is written, "You are sons to Hashem your G-d." Therefore it is very good to express one's words and troubles before Him like a son who complains before his father with cute and endearing motions.

      <h3>8. The Main Thing is to Make from the Torahs, Prayers</h3>
      <p>
        And the main thing is to make from the Torahs, prayers. To beseech every day, and to express his words before Him according to whichever Torah he is learning in his holy books, for in all of them he can find himself every day.

giving tithe he is saved from haters because Hashem, blessed be He,
covers him with His hand and saves him because &quot;G-d seeks the
pursued&quot; and even a tzadik pursues the wicked (Midrash Rabbah
Emor Parsha 27) and this is aspects of &quot;And in the shadow of My
hand I have covered you&quot; [Isaiah 51] that Hashem, blessed be He,
covers over him in the shadow of His hand and saves him and when the
pursued is a tzadik that he is close to Hashem, blessed be He, then
Hashem, blessed be He, saves him with His hand because he is close to
Hashem, blessed be He, but when the pursued is wicked it is found
that he is distant from Hashem, blessed be He, and nevertheless
Hashem, blessed be He, saves him because G-d seeks etc. then as if
Hashem, blessed be He, enlarges His hand and extends it and covers
over him even though he is distant from Hashem, blessed be He, and by
tithe is made aspects of the great hand because the great hand is
aspects of sufficiency as it is written &quot;Shall flocks and herds
be slaughtered for them and suffice for them or all the fish of the
sea&quot; etc. &quot;and suffice for them&quot; and Onkelos
translated whether it will suffice for them and Hashem, blessed be
He, answered: &quot;Shall the hand of G-d be short&quot; it is found
that aspects of the great hand it is able to suffice them it is found
that aspects of sufficiency it is in aspects of the great hand and by
tithe it is in aspects of sufficiency because a person does not die
and half his desire in his hand because if he has a hundred he seeks
two hundred etc. and all that he has does not suffice him but in
tithe it is written &quot;Bring all the tithe to the storehouse and
test Me now in this etc. until without enough&quot; and our Rabbis,
their memory for blessing, expounded (Shabbos 32:): until your lips
wear out from saying enough it is found that by tithe is made aspects
of sufficiency, that it is aspects of the great hand as above and by
this Hashem, blessed be He, extends His hand and covers over him and
is saved from haters as above &quot;I have set G-d before me always&quot;
aspects of opponent.</font></font></font></p>

FREEDOM - LIBERTY - EMANCIPATION Sunday, August 24, 2025 Likutay Moharan - Torah-teaching 46 Likutay Moharan Volume 1: Torah 46 Likutay Moharan Volume 1: Torah 46 Clapping of Palms in Prayer [In the language of our master, Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, of blessed memory] Striking palm to palm at the time of prayer, this is the aspect of giving the bed [positioning] between north [attribute of judgment] and south [attribute of wisdom] [Brachos 5b]. For bed is the aspect of mating [spiritual or physical union] and the aspect of prayer [Zohar Tikkunim 10; see Tikkun 58]. North and south are aspects of hands [right and left attributes]. This is what Abba Binyamin prayed [Brachos 5b]: &#8220;That his prayer be close to his bed,&#8221; that there be no separation between the prayer and the mating. Also, through striking palm to palm, the dinim (judgments [divine strictures]) are sweetened. For there are three Havayas [permutations of the Divine Name Y-H-V-H], the aspect of three hands: the great hand [divine power], the strong hand [divine strength], the high hand [exalted power]. The right hand [attribute of chessed (kindness)] is the great hand. The left hand [attribute of gevurah (strength)] is the strong hand. At the time of striking [clapping] that they are connected together, this is the aspect of the high hand. The speeches [words] that come out, they come out from the throat, which has a numerical equivalence equal to three times Elokim [G-d&#8217;s Name, judgment, numerical value 86]. They are sweetened through the three Havayas. This is the explanation of: &#8220;My soul in my palm continually, etc., and Your Torah I have not forgotten.&#8221; [Psalms 119:109] &#8220;My soul,&#8221; this is the aspect of speech, as it is written: &#8220;My soul went out when he spoke.&#8221; [Song of Songs 5:6] Also, the aspect of prayer, as it is written: &#8220;He tears his soul in his anger.&#8221; [Job 18:4] [Brachos 5b, brought regarding prayer]. &#8220;In my palm continually,&#8221; that is, when he strikes palm to palm at the time of prayer, through this, &#8220;and Your Torah I have not forgotten.&#8221; The initial letters of this phrase [ ו&#1456;תו&#1465;ר&#1464;ת&#1456;ך&#1464; ל&#1465;א ש&#1473;&#1464;כ&#1463;ח&#1456;ת&#1468;&#1460;י ] form Sh a L e V (calm/peace [numerical value 336]), which has a numerical equivalence equal to three Havayas [3 x 26 = 78] and three Elokims [3 x 86 = 258], signifying the sweetening of the dinim . Also, the main forgetfulness [memory lapse] is from brains of smallness [constricted state of consciousness], from the aspect of Elokim [G-d&#8217;s Name, judgment]. When he sweetens the Elokim in his palms, through this, &#8220;and Your Torah I have not forgotten.&#8221; This is the explanation of: &#8220;For he desired Me, and I will deliver him.&#8221; [Psalms 91:14] &#8220;For he desired Me,&#8221; numerical equivalence 42 [Zohar Tikkunim Introduction 7b], that is, three times hand [numerical value 14, 3 x 14 = 42], revealing the desire in the heart through the hands. This is the aspect of striking of hands, through which &#8220;and I will deliver him,&#8221; the aspect of sweetening the dinim . Also, through striking palm to palm, dispute is nullified. For all disputes are drawn from the aspect of Korach against Aharon, which are the aspect of left and right [Zohar Beraishis 17a]. Through striking palm to palm, the left is included in the right, and the right in the left, and they become unity. &#8220;His lightnings lit up the world; the earth saw.&#8221; [Psalms 97:4] &#8220;World,&#8221; this is the aspect of striking of hands, for the right is 72 [numerical value of chessed ], and the left is 216 [numerical value of gevurah ]. Through their inclusion in each other, it becomes two times 216, numerical equivalence of &#8220;world&#8221; [432]. Also, 72, which is the right, contains three times 72, numerical equivalence 216, the aspect of High Priest, ordinary priest, and deputy priest. Through the world being seen&#8212;that is, striking of hands&#8212; &#8220;His lightnings lit up,&#8221; the dispute, called lightning, is rectified, as it is written: &#8220;And His arrow went out like lightning.&#8221; [Zechariah 9:14] Arrow means dispute [Genesis 49:24]: &#8220;And the owners of arrows hated him,&#8221; and its Targum: &#8220;Owners of disputes.&#8221; This is the explanation of: &#8220;All the peoples, strike palm,&#8221; [Psalms 47:2] meaning connection, for two times 72 and 216 is the numerical equivalence of &#8220;strike&#8221; [432]. Before I copied this Torah from his holy writing, I wrote some of this matter myself as I heard it, and some things are explained there a bit more. Therefore, I copied it as well, and both are good together. The matter of striking palm to palm at the time of prayer, it is written in *Pri Etz Chaim* [Gate of Repeating the Amidah, Chapter 7, end]: &#8220;I was at peace, and He shook me.&#8221; [Job 16:12] Sh a L e V (calm/peace), numerical equivalence three Havayas and three Elokims. The initial letters of &#8220;And He will place peace for you&#8221; [Numbers 6:26] are Sh a L e V (calm/peace), that is, three times Havaya sweetens three Elokims. For there are three hands: the great hand, the strong hand, the high hand. They are: the right hand is the great hand, the left hand is the strong hand, and through the embracing of the hands, the high hand is made. Therefore, when he strikes palm to palm and connects the hands in prayer, the dinim are sweetened. For hand is the aspect of Havaya, the letter yud is the letters, and vav-dalet is the letters. Through three hands, which are three Havayas, the three Elokims, which are the dinim coming from the throat, numerical equivalence three Elokims, are sweetened. It is a segula (remedy [spiritual practice]) for memory, as it is written: &#8220;My soul in my palm continually.&#8221; &#8220;My soul,&#8221; the aspect of prayer [Song of Songs 5:6]: &#8220;My soul went out when he spoke.&#8221; &#8220;In my palm continually,&#8221; when he strikes palm to palm at the time of prayer, through this, &#8220;and Your Torah I have not forgotten.&#8221; For forgetfulness is from brains of smallness, the aspect of Elokim. When he sweetens the dinim as mentioned above, he is in brains of greatness [expanded state of consciousness], and he has no forgetfulness. And Your Torah I have not forgotten, the initial letters Sh a L e V (calm/peace), that is, through sweetening three Elokims with three Havayas as mentioned above, he has no forgetfulness. This is precisely at the time of prayer, for then he knows if he is in brains of smallness or brains of greatness, for speech is the revelation [expression] of the brains, as it is written: &#8220;From His mouth knowledge and understanding.&#8221; [Proverbs 2:6] Posted by NaaNaach at 6:07&#8239;AM Email This BlogThis!

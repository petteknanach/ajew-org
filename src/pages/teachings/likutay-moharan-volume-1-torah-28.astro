  <p>28 - Build for Us a House in the Air of the World</p>
  <p>[Introduction: In the language of our rabbi, of blessed memory]
Build for us a house in the air of the world, he said a shem [Name], stood and hung between shemaya [heavens] and ar'a [earth]. He said to them, bring out for me livnay [bricks] and tina [clay] from there. They said: And who is there that can bring [it] up there. He said: And who is there that can build a house between shemaya and ar'a.</p>
  <p>1. The opponents who despise and revile the fearers of Hashem [the Name, i.e., G-d], this is because they receive Torah [Teaching/Law] from Talmeeday Chachamim Shaidin Yihoodu-in [(Torah) scholars (who are) Jewish Demons, human scholars whose Torah is influenced by demonic forces, as distinct from actual demons who learn Torah; see Zohar Pinchas 252b]. For the Talmeeday Chachamim Shaidin Yihoodu-in, they receive their Torah from the demons who have fallen Torah from the fallen Alefs [the first letter of the Hebrew Alef-bes, also read as Elef, meaning a thousand]. And in these teachings it is written regarding Solomon (I Kings 5:12) "And he spoke three thousand parables and his song was a thousand and five". For Solomon merited to them in holiness, but Talmeeday Chachamim Shaidin Yihoodu-in receive from them [in the] way of the klipos [husks, i.e., forces of impurity]. And for this, all their speech is in the way of parable, figure of speech, and wonderful reasons, for its root [is] from these fallen teachings aforementioned. And [regarding] these Talmeeday Chachamim, it is said (Isaiah 7:9) "Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary also G-d". For they weary men who come to hear their drash [homily] and their Torah, and men think that they will come to some benefit by their hand—that is, that they will come to know G-d [and] how to serve [Him]. And they, the men, do not attain any benefit, for [the] Torah of these Talmeeday Chachamim has no power to guide the person in the good way, for from evil does not become good (see Talmud Bavli, Berachos 29a; Beraishis Rabbah 22:7; Vayikra Rabbah 19:2; and see Shabbat 129a). And not only [that], [but] you weary also G-d, as if [they] weary the Holy One, blessed be He, from helping those who serve Him. It turns out that by means of this, these children of man fall in great heresies and think, Heaven forbid, "G-d does not see and does not understand in the deed of children of man". By means of this, "The fearers of Hashem they do not honor", and [they] revile and shame them. And for this, shame is called service of idols, as it is written (Hosea 9:10) "And they separated themselves to shame", for the shame and the reviling is made from the heresies.</p>
  <p>2. And when there is for fearers of Hashem revilings and shames from these heretics, [the] counsel on this: "I am a tole’a [worm/scarlet] and not a man, reproach of man" (Psalms 22:7)—for revilings and disgraces, the segula [propitious] for this [is the] aspect of tole’a, that by means of [this] aspect, he conquers his enemies. For tole’a is [the] aspect of emunah [faith], as it is written (Lamentations 4:5) "The faithful upon tole’a [scarlet/worm]". And it is [the] aspect of Abraham, that he is head to the believers, as it is written (Genesis 15:6) "And he believed in Hashem". And in the aspect of Abraham, that he is [the] aspect of emunah, [he] breaks and nullifies service of idols and the heresies and the disgraces, and prevails over the heretics in [the] aspect of "In mighty acts, salvation of His right hand" (Psalms 20:7). For Abraham, that he is [the] aspect of chesed [lovingkindness], [the] aspect of emunah, [the] aspect of "And My chesed I will not withhold, and I will not falsify in My emunah" (Psalms 89:34)—in the right, [through] this, he prevails over his enemies. For there is made in [the] aspect of "Men of strength clad in tole’a [scarlet]" (Nahum 2:4). And through this chesed, he rectifies these fallen teachings aforementioned in [the] aspect of "And does chesed to thousands" (Exodus 20:6).</p>
  <p>3. And to come to chesed, [it is] impossible to come except by means of that he brings in Talmeeday Chachamim tzadikim [righteous Torah scholars] into his house. For the one who brings in guests, Talmeeday Chachamim true, into his house, [it is] as if [he] offered continual offerings [temidim] as the saying of our sages, of blessed memory (Talmud Bavli, Berachos 10b): A holy man passes over us continual and so on. And in this, the service that he stands over them and serves them, [he] merits to the chesed aforementioned, as the saying (Talmud Bavli, Kesuvos 96a): Everyone who prevents his disciple from serving him, [it is] as if [he] prevents from him chesed. And for this, the continual was a keves [lamb, root כבש] for from it were rectified the teachings in [the] aspect of "And I like a docile keves [keves alluf]" (Jeremiah 11:19). And this is [the] aspect of keves that is kavush [subdued, root כבש] under the hand of his rabbi and serves them. And this tamid [continual, gematria 445] [is] gematria [numerical value] four teachings [four Alefs, each 111, totaling 444, plus one for the inclusive equals 445], that it is [the] rectification of the teachings as above. And this is "To whom contentions, to whom siach [ranting/invective]" (Proverbs 23:29)—that is, by means of siach [ranting], by means of [Talmeeday Chachamim] Shaidin Yihoodu-in, by his hand contentions, by his hand comes opposition. And this is what the elders of the house of the furnace said: Build for us a house in the air of the world. For these children of man who want to arrange their service by means of the Torah that they hear from Talmeeday Chachamim Shaidin Yihoodu-in, and in truth, there is no for them on what they rely, and it is as if they want to build a house in the air, and there is no for them on what they rely, like the demons that fly in the air. And he said shem, and stood between shemaya and ar'a—that is, the true Talmid Chacham [Torah scholar], he is between shemaya and ar'a, as its Targum: "For all in the heavens and in the earth" [that holds in heavens and earth]. And he said, bring out for me livnay and tina from there—for tina enters in their heart of these as above, and there is made their heart a heart of stone. And when the true Talmid Chacham sees their evil thought, [he] says to them that they bring out the tina from their heart, that they bring out the tina that is in [the] heart of stone and not deny the Holy One, blessed be He. For the tina and [the] heart of stone [are] from hasam [there, gematria 445], that is, from [the] aspect of the fallen teachings aforementioned, that they are gematria hasam [four Alefs, each 111, totaling 444, plus one for the inclusive equals 445, corresponding to the fallen teachings]. They said: Who is there that can bring up hasam [there, i.e., raise the four fallen Alefs]—that they said to him: Who can raise the fallen teachings. And he replied to them, who is there that can build a house between shemaya and ar'a—that is, who builds his house by means of Talmeeday Chachamim true, for there is for them on what they rely, for true Talmeeday Chachamim they are [the] foundation of every thing. And who his house is [a] house of meeting for Chachamim [sages], that builds his house in [the] aspect of: "A holy man passes over us continual, let us make an attic of wall" (II Kings 4:10)—these men elevate the teachings as above.</p>
  <p>[4.] And this [is] א ב ג ד [aleph bes gimmel dalet]: ג ד [gimmel dalet], this [is] shemaya and ar'a. ב [bet]—who builds his house between shemaya and ar'a, this [is the] rectification of the teachings. ז ח [zayin chet]—that is, these children of man who receive their Torah from Shaidin Yihoodu-in, that are called by [the] name zayin, [the] aspect of "To the goats that they commit infidelity" (Leviticus 17:7). From them [come] the reviling and the disgraces in [the] aspect of "And contempt of families terrifies me" (Job 31:34), [the] aspect of chet. ה ו [he vav]—hoy vay [woe, alas], language of cry and controversy, as above, to whom contentions, to whom siach—that is, zayin chet. ט י [tet yud]—good hidden in it, for one needs, when he hears Torah from Talmeeday Chachamim Shaidin Yihoodu-in, that he eat the good that is in it, as (Talmud Bavli, Chagigah 15b) Rabbi Meir, [a] pomegranate, found its inside, ate, as it is written (Proverbs 23:24) "My son, give your heart to me" and it is written (Proverbs 22:17) "Hear the words of Chachamim and set your heart to my knowledge". And when he does so, [he] elevates [the] good, the hidden in it, that is, the fallen teachings, and this [is] tet, good hidden in it (Introduction to the Zohar 3a), that you set your heart to the good, the hidden in his words. And by means of this yud—that is, you rectify by means of this the teachings, [the] aspect of "I will thank Your shem for You have done wonder" (Isaiah 25:1), this aleph and this yud, form of aleph and this yud, language of odeh [I will thank, root ידה], yud, [the] aspect of "And they cast stone" (Lamentations 3:53), language of casting, that is, its klipah he threw.
[Until here the language of our rabbi, of blessed memory]</p>
  <p>[Explanation of Parashat haTamid]
And we heard from his holy mouth, that this Torah is hinted in it all the intentions that of parashat haTamid [continual offering] that they say in the morning. And he explained to us a little. And see in the intentions, and you will see and understand that all the intentions of parashat haTamid are explained in this Torah aforementioned. For there is explained in the intentions, that tamid subdues klipos of Asiyah [world of action] and so on, that they are [the] aspect of idolatry and so on, and "olah [burnt offering]" gematria shem אבג יתץ [ABG YTZ, numerical value 614] and so on, that is in chesed, and so on, in [the] secret of: "And Abraham rose early in the morning" (Genesis 22:3), and it is [the] secret of: "Fear not tole’a" (Isaiah 41:14) and so on, and there is opposite it in the klipah a tole’a that consumes and eats everything and so on, and therefore commanded Hashem, blessed be He, in His mercy to offer olah of tamid to prevail, olah of tamid that is in holiness, that is [the] aspect of tole’a of Jacob, on the tole’a that is in the klipah and so on. And know that every sacrifice of olah, it is in [the] aspect of Leah and so on, and therefore came olah of tamid opposite her, in order to sweeten her judgments in order that [the] impure tole’a not rule and govern, and tole’a shall return to olah. And this is what is written: olah tamid [burnt offering continual], for tamid [is] gematria four teachings [445, numerical value of four Alefs plus one] that takes Leah and so on, all this is explained in Pri Etz Chaim, Gate of the Sacrifices, Chapter 4, see there well and scrutinize, and you will see that all this is explained in the Torah aforementioned, for there is explained, that the opponents who revile fearers of Hashem, this is drawn from the fallen teachings, that these teachings in holiness, they are [the] aspect of Leah, and with them is made from this [the] aspect of: "Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary also G-d", as if [they] weary the Holy One, blessed be He, and so on, for from Leah, is made with them [the] aspect of wearies, for they suck from the hard judgments that are in Leah, from where [the] holding of the hard klipos that they are [the] aspect of idolatry aforementioned. And this is what is explained in this Torah, that they fall in heresy, [the] aspect of idolatry, see there. And the rectification: I am a tole’a and not a man and so on—that is, [the] aspect of tole’a of holiness that subdues tole’a of klipah. And this [is] what is brought above in this Torah, that it is [the] aspect of Abraham, for so is explained there in the intentions, that tole’a of holiness, [the] aspect of olah of tamid, it is [the] aspect of chesed, [the] aspect of Abraham, [the] aspect of chesed in gevurah [strength]. And this [is] what is brought there, that the main of the rectification [is] by means of that he brings in guests, Talmeeday Chachamim, into his house, that is considered as if [he] offered temidim, for tamid [is] gematria four teachings, for the main of the rectification [is] by means of [the] aspect of sacrifice of tamid, that ascends four teachings, by means of this are rectified the teachings aforementioned, and [he] merits to [the] aspect of tole’a of holiness, that is [the] aspect of olah of tamid, [the] aspect of chesed to Abraham, see in this Torah and in the intentions well, and you will understand how are included all the intentions of parashat haTamid in this Torah aforementioned.</p>

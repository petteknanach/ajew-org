that sometimes when a decree is decreed on the person, G-d forbid,
some decree and even though he does not see his mazal (fortune) sees
(Megillah 3) and because of this he wants to hide himself and from
this comes that sometimes suddenly the person travels to some distant
place this is in order to hide himself and even though he does not
know from this, nevertheless the soul knows from this therefore comes
to him a will to travel there and sometimes when he comes there he is
publicized there more, and then he can harm him very much, G-d
forbid, and from this was the departure of a very great tzadik that
suddenly wanted to travel to the Land of Israel and he himself knew
from this that he needed to hide himself and traveled on the country
and there was great publicity, and he departed on that way and
similarly happened in our time nearby may Hashem save us.</font></font></font></p>

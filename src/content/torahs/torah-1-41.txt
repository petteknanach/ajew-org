Likutay Moharan Volume 1: Torah 41
“Rikudin (Dances [spiritual movements])”
[In the language of our master, Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, of blessed memory]
1. Dancing and Sweetening Judgments
It is brought in Aitz Chayim (Tree of Life [Kabbalistic text by Rabbi Chaim Vital], folio 22a) that the birkayim (knees [legs]) are Netzach (Eternity/Victory [divine emanation]) and Hod (Splendor/Glory [divine emanation]), and they are called akeivim (heels). The gematria (numerical value) of akeiv (heel) is equal to two times Elokim (G-d’s Name [judgment, value 86]), which are dinim (judgments [divine strictures]). This indicates that there is an achizah (grasping [hold]) for the chitzonim (externals [evil forces]) there, as is known. The action to drive away the chitzonim (externals) from there is that one draws into the birkayim (knees) the gevuros (strengths [divine powers]) from the root of Binah (Understanding [divine emanation]). And when he draws the root of the gevuros (strengths) from Binah (Understanding), then the chitzonim (externals) flee from there. And he takes the bechorah (birthright [spiritual inheritance]) and the berachah (blessing [divine favor]), for this is the aspect of birkayim (knees). And the root of the bechoros (birthrights) is called yayin (wine [spiritual joy]), as is known. And this is yayin hamesamai’ach (wine that gladdens) [Psalms 104:15]. And this is what is written by Yaakov, when he saw that he is the aspect of birkayim (knees) in the place of din (judgment), for two times Elokim (G-d’s Name) with ten letters [gematria 172 + 10 = 182, equaling Yaakov יַעֲקֹב]. Then he drew the root of the gevuros (strengths), the aspect of yayin hamesamai’ach (wine that gladdens), as it is written: “And he brought him yayin (wine) and he drank” [Genesis 27:25]. This is the root of the berachah (blessing). It emerges that through rikudin (dances)—that is, through drinking yayin hamesamai’ach (wine that gladdens), which are the root of the gevuros (strengths) that are in Binah (Understanding) and are drawn below into the legs—one dances. In this way, he drives away the chitzonim (externals) from there. And this is the hisla’havus (flaming [spiritual fervor]) of the dance, and it is “A fire offering, a pleasing aroma to Hashem” [Numbers 28:24]. However, one who dances in the hisla’havus (flaming) of the yaitzer (inclination [evil impulse]), this is called the sin of Nadav and Avihu, regarding whom it is written: “And they offered strange fire” [Leviticus 10:1]. Nadav and Avihu are also Netzach (Eternity) and Hod (Splendor). And hisla’havus (flaming) that is in kedushah (holiness) is called yayin hamesamai’ach (wine that gladdens), through which the bechoros (birthrights) are sweetened. But strange fire is called yayin hamashkir (wine that intoxicates [causing deviation]), which is the hisla’havus (flaming) of the yaitzer (inclination), and there is, Heaven forbid, an achizah (grasping) for the chitzonim (externals), “which He did not command them.”
2. Redemption of the Soul
And this also refers to the pidyon nefesh (redemption of the soul [payment to a tzadik for intercession]).
For mamon (money [material wealth]) is called amudim (pillars [sustenance]), as it is written: “And the yikum (standing [wealth]) that is on their feet” [Deuteronomy 11:24; Pesachim 119a]. And when the tzadik (righteous person) who performs the pidyon (redemption) lays his hands on the mamon (money), he should intend for “there is the yad hagedolah (great hand [divine power]) etc.” And that means three hands [yad hagedolah (great hand), yad chazakah (strong hand), yad ramah (high hand)]. And three times yud (letter yud [value 10]) has a gematria (numerical value) of 42. And the Shem Mem-Bais (Name of 42 [Kabbalistic divine name]) has seven names, and each name has six letters. And he should intend to draw to him the vavim (vavs [letter vav, value 6]), which are the seven names that each one has six letters, to draw them into the mamon (money), which is called amudim (pillars). And then it is called vavai ha’amudim (vavs of the pillars). And these amudim (pillars), which are legs, that is, akeivim (heels), they are the aspect of din (judgment), for two times Elokim (G-d’s Name) has the gematria (numerical value) of akeiv (heel). And there is achizah (grasping) there for the chitzonim (externals). And din (judgment) is not sweetened except in its root. And the root of the dinim (judgments) is in Binah (Understanding), as it is written in the Zohar [Vayikra 10a]: “Binah dinin mis’arin minah (Understanding, judgments are aroused from it).” And it is written: “I am Binah (Understanding), gevurah (power [divine might]) is mine” [Proverbs 8:14]. And the Shem Mem-Bais (Name of 42) is in Binah (Understanding). It emerges that when he draws the Shem Mem-Bais (Name of 42) into the amudim (pillars), then the dinim (judgments) are sweetened in their root, as it is written: “Vavai ha’amudim (Vavs of the pillars) and their fillets kesef (silver [kindness])” [Exodus 27:17]. [Through the attachment of the vavim (vavs) with the amudim (pillars), kesef (silver) is created, which is chesed (kindness [divine attribute]), meaning the dinim (judgments) are sweetened.] This is discussed in Aitz Chayim (Tree of Life), Chapter 13 (Hall of the Crowns, Gate 1). The Shem Mem-Bais (Name of 42) is in Binah (Understanding), and these 42 are 300 lights that illuminate. “Eight whiteness” has the gematria (numerical value) of bashalom (in peace) [Aitz Chayim, Chapter 14]. This is also the gematria (numerical value) of chashmal (mystical substance [angelic garment]), which is a garment. This chashmal (mystical substance) guards upper garments from the osh (moth [evil force]) of the klipah (husk), as it is written: “Like a garment the osh (moth) shall eat them” [Isaiah 51:8]. And this is what is stated [Yoma 71b]: “One who wants to pour yayin (wine) on the mizbai’ach (altar [place of judgments]), let him fill the throats of talmidai chachamim (Torah scholars [sages]) to pour.” “Pouring” is meluchah (kingship [dominion]) and memshalah (rule), as it is written: “And I have poured My king” [Psalms 2:6]. Yayin (wine) is the aspect of Binah (Understanding), the root of the bechorah (birthright), yayin hamesamai’ach (wine that gladdens). Mizbai’ach (altar) is the aspect of dinim (judgments). Talmidai chachamim (Torah scholars) are the aspect of Netzach (Eternity) and Hod (Splendor). [One who wants to make a king and to rule, and to sweeten the dinim (judgments) through their root, which is yayin hamesamai’ach (wine that gladdens), what shall he do? Good advice: “On this, let him fill their throats,” meaning through rikudin (dances), or through pidyon (redemption), as brought above.] Also, through “filling their throats,” the dinim (judgments) are sweetened, as stated [Berachos 64a]: “Talmidai chachamim (Torah scholars) increase shalom (peace) in the world.” For through them the Shem Mem-Bais (Name of 42) is drawn, which are 300 lights, and with eight whiteness, which has the gematria (numerical value) bashalom (in peace). And Talmidai chachamim (Torah scholars) are called Netzach (Eternity) and Hod (Splendor), “legs,” as brought in the Midrash [Beraishis Rabbah 74:1] regarding the verse: “His legs, amudai shaish (pillars of marble)” [Song of Songs 5:15], that they are talmidai chachamim (Torah scholars) [see Targum Yonatan]. And also, the mizbai’ach (altar) is called “legs,” as it is written: “Sacrifice zivchai tzedek (sacrifices of righteousness)” [Psalms 4:6], and as it is written: “Tzedek (Righteousness [divine justice]) shall go before Him” [Psalms 85:14]. And this is the explanation: “May He give you according to your heart”, and when? When “And all your aitzah (counsel [divine plan]) He will fulfill” [Psalms 20:5]. This is through filling the throats of talmidai chachamim (Torah scholars), as it is written [Avot 6:3]: “And they enjoy from him aitzah (counsel) and tushiyah (wisdom).” And as it is written: “The aitzas Hashem (counsel of Hashem) stands forever” [Psalms 33:11], for they [talmidai chachamim (Torah scholars)] are amudai olam (pillars of the world). “Hashem Tzeva’os (of Hosts [divine name, linked to Netzach and Hod]) has counseled” [Isaiah 14:27].

        Do not be like an ass [chamor], which does not know its owner. For the ass is the aspect of the yetzer hara [evil inclination], which is compared to an ass. For the yetzer hara is called a "chamor" because it is stubborn and does not listen to the voice of reason. And like an ass that does not know its owner, the yetzer hara does not recognize Hashem, blessed is He, as its Master. For the yetzer hara is the aspect of the sitra achara [other side], which is separated from Hashem. Therefore, one must always fight against the yetzer hara and not listen to its voice. For the yetzer hara always tries to lead a person astray from the path of truth.
      </p>

        And this is what our Sages, of blessed memory, said (Kiddushin 30b): "The yetzer hara is called 'evil' from its birth." For it is born with a person, and it is always trying to lead him to evil. And the way to combat it is through Torah study and the performance of mitzvot. For Torah is compared to a bridle, as it is written: "TheTorah of Hashem is perfect" (Psalms 19:8), and our Sages, of blessed memory, said that Torah is like a bridle that controls the horse. Similarly, Torah controls the yetzer hara and prevents it from leading a person astray.
      </p>

      <p>
        And this is also the aspect of the redemption from Egypt, for they were redeemed from the "house of bondage," which is the aspect of the yetzer hara. For the Egyptians are compared to an ass, as it is written: "And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar and in bricks" (Exodus 1:14). And the redemption from Egypt was the beginning of the redemption from the yetzer hara. And we were given the Torah to control the yetzer hara and to lead us on the path of truth.

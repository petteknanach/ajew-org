who has eyes to see can see and recognize in the face of the disciple
who is his Rebbe and only that he saw his Rebbe once because &quot;The
wisdom of a man illuminates his face&quot; [Ecclesiastes 8] it is
found that when the disciple receives the wisdom of his Rebbe he
receives his face and therefore one needs to gaze on the face of his
Rebbe at the time that he receives his wisdom as it is written &quot;And
your eyes shall see your teachers&quot; [Isaiah 30] because the
wisdom is in the face as above and therefore when he gazes on the
face of the disciple he can know who is his Rebbe as above.</font></font></font></p>

        <strong>The Formation and Protection of the Sukkah</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Tzairay is the aspect of "And He formed" (Genesis 2:7), a formation for good, a formation for evil, 
        a formation for reward, a formation for punishment (Zohar Beraishis 27a and Ra'aya Mehemna Behar 111a). 
        And in Berakhot 61a, this is the aspect of din (judgment) and mercy. This is the aspect of binah 
        (understanding), for there the fetus is formed, as it is written: "If to understanding you call" 
        (Proverbs 2:3). And there are two aspects: chesed (kindness) and din (judgment), for from there 
        (binah) judgments are aroused (Zohar Vayikra 10a). And it is the aspect of sukkah, as it is written: 
        "You have screened me in my mother's belly" (Psalms 139:13).
      </p>

      <p>
        And it is the aspect of the koach (power) of tefillah (prayer), that is, what they pray with power, 
        as it is written: "All my bones shall say" (Psalms 35:10). And it is the aspect of sukkah, as it is written: 
        "With sinews and bones You have screened me" (Job 10:11). For the power that a person inserts into 
        the letters—these are the twenty-eight letters of the work of Genesis, with which the world was created 
        (Avot, chapter 5)—they receive power from these twenty-eight letters.
      </p>

      <p>
        And the utterances with which the world was created, they are the aspect of chesed (kindness), as it is written: 
        "For I said, a world of kindness shall be built" (Psalms 89:3). And chesed is the aspect of sukkah, 
        the aspect of chibbuk (embrace). And this is: "And I place My words in your mouth," then 
        "And in the shadow of My hand I have covered you" (Isaiah 51:16), which is the aspect of sukkah, 
        which is the aspect of the shadow of a hand, the chibbuk (embrace) of the right hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the speeches that are not holy speeches then cause the Sukkas Notzrim to be aroused, the sukkah of the nations, 
        as it is written: "Whose mouth speaks vanity and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood" (Psalms 144:8), 
        which is the chibbuk (embrace) of the sitra achara (other side, evil forces). And this is the interpretation of: 
        "You shall hide them in a sukkah from the strife of tongues" (Psalms 31:21). For when the tongues of the nations prevail, 
        Heaven forbid, then the Shekhinah (Divine Presence) is in riv (strife) with the Holy One, blessed be He.
      </p>

      <p>
        And the main essence of the Eretz Yisrael (Land of Israel) is through the koach (power) of His works, 
        as it is written: "The power of His works He has declared to His people, to give them the inheritance of nations" 
        (Psalms 111:6). But when this koach (power), which is the aspect of sukkah, is damaged, then the nations of the world prevail.
      </p>

      <p>
        And for this reason, sukkah, that is, tefillah (prayer) with koach (power), is a segulah (propitious quality) for sons. 
        And for this reason, immediately after Sukkot is Shemini Atzeret, when the nukva (female, Malkhut) detains and collects 
        the drop so that it does not drop. And this is the aspect of: "You have screened me in my mother's belly," 
        which is the aspect of sukkah; there the aspect of ibbur (pregnancy, spiritual formation) is made.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, the Eretz Yisrael (Land of Israel) is a segulah for sons, as our Sages, of blessed memory, said: 
        "Go forth from your land" (Genesis 12:1)—and there you shall merit sons. And this is because of: 
        "The reward of the fruit of the womb" (Psalms 127:3), the reward of sukkah, the aspect of: 
        "You have screened me in my mother's belly."
      </p>

      <p>
        And this is the aspect of: "He has told you, O man, what is good, and what Hashem requires of you: 
        but to do justice" (Micah 6:8). This is din (judgment). "And loving kindness"—this is the aspect of inner chasadim. 
        "And to walk humbly"—this is the aspect of the makkifim (encompassing lights), the aspect of sukkah.
      </p>

      <p>
        And in the future, when the nations of the world will be tested by the commandment of sukkah, 
        then it will be fulfilled: "For then I will turn to all the peoples a pure language" (Zephaniah 3:9). 
        Safah (language) is the aspect of sukkah. Also then, the riv (strife) of tongues will be reversed, 
        and there will not be the aspect of riv. And there will be "One language to serve Him with one accord."
      </p>

      <p>
        And this is: "If you do well, you will be lifted up" (Genesis 4:7). "At the entrance sin crouches" 
        (Genesis 4:7), referring to the reversal of faces, which is the aspect of riv (strife), which is riv in galuta (exile), 
        where the nations of the world prevail, the riv (strife) of tongues, "Whose mouth speaks vanity."
      </p>

      <p>
        And this is the interpretation of "in the waters of strife" —this is the aspect of the waters of chasadim (kindnesses), 
        the aspect of sukkah, which saves from the riv (strife) of tongues, as it is written: 
        "You shall hide them in a sukkah from the strife of tongues."

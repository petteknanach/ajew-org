      <p>In his childhood it occurred to him to have abstinence from this world and he desired to break the desire for eating, however he still had small intellect and it seemed to him that this is impossible, for him to forego from his eating, from what he was accustomed to eat in the morning and in the afternoon etc.. therefore he settled with himself that he would swallow everything that he ate, that is that he would not chew what he ate, just swallow it the way it was, in order that he should not derive any taste from his eating. And he did this, and his throat became swollen (which is called gishvellen). And he said that he was just six years old. And this practice I heard as a great feat of a very extremely great tzadik who practice this (t.n. this is related of the Chasam Sofer who lived around that time), that he would swallow his food without chewing, however he of blessed memory, practiced this when he was 6 years old.</p>

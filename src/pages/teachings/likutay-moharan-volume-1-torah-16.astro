  <p>16 - That fish that took out its head from water
[Language of our rabbi, of blessed memory] Rabbi Yochanan speaking: one time we were going in ship, and saw that fish that took out its head from water, and similar its eye as two moons, and spits water from two nostrils as two rivers of Sura (Bava Basra 74)
Rashbam: and spits and poured. nostrils nostrils. rivers of Sura rivers that in Sura and saw that fish which is the tzadik, called by name fish, as known (see Maorai Or entry fish) that took out its head from water, and similar its eye as two moons, and spits water from two nostrils as two rivers of Sura because impossible to the tzadik to be his thought wandering always in upper wisdoms because sometimes needs to go out outside to engage in words of the world as our sages, of blessed memory, said (Menachos 99:): times nullification of Torah this its fulfillment and when took out head from water that is when takes out himself from upper wisdom then: and similar its eye as two moons because opening of eyes called on name the wisdom as written (Genesis 3): "and opened eyes of both" and when engages in his wisdom then his eyes in aspect of sun and when removes himself from to wander in wisdom was this as coming of sun and when comes the sun then remain his eyes in aspect of moons because moon no illuminates except when removed the sun and this aspect of: and our eyes illuminate as the sun and as the moon sometimes illuminate as the sun when we attached in wisdom and sometimes illuminate as the moon when remove ourselves from to wander in wisdom and spits water from two nostrils they aspect of two Messiahs (see Zohar Pinchas 246: 252:) that to them the nations seek and draw themselves to them as written (Isaiah 2): "and stream to him all the nations" and this: two rivers of Sura Sura this aspects of nations on name idolatry as written (Exodus 32): "turned quickly from the way" and they included in two nations: Esau and Ishmael and through these two Messiahs which they two nostrils aspect of (Lamentations 4) "spirit of our nose Messiah of Hashem" through them redeemed and drawn as rivers by them to learn word of Hashem and two nations Esau and Ishmael they two clouds that cover on the eyes that no can to illuminate always in aspect of sun and for this needs the tzadik to nullify his attachment in order that not overpower the nations Esau and Ishmael on his eyes and nullified, G-d forbid, his wisdom completely but through two Messiahs that scatter their springs outside and turned to all pure language then fulfilled (Isaiah 30): "and was light of the moon as light of the sun" and then not need to nullify from his attachment [from siman 15 until here language of our rabbi, of blessed memory]</p>

        And Yitzro heard, the splitting of the Sea of Reeds and the wars of Amalek, the splitting of the Sea of Reeds, this is the nullification of times, and Hashem looked down upon the camp of Mitzrayim in a pillar of fire and cloud and confounded them, pillar of fire this is night, and cloud this is day, and the Holy One, blessed be He, mixed them and nullified the times, the war of Amalek, this is teshuvah, Moshe, Aharon, and Chur, Rashi explained they were engaged in fasting, and Yitzro heard, he heard the voice.

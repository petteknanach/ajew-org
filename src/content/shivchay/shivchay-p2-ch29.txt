And in the Land of Israel he engaged in Torah and prayer, and every day he wrote by himself his Torah (-original holy insights). And he boasted tremendously and said that the difference between the Torah of chutz-lu'uretz (-outside Israel) to the Torah of the Land of Israel is like the distance between east and west (see Beraishis Rabah, parsha 16 - there is no Torah like the Torah of the Land of Israel etc.). And every single day the big/great with the small went to him to wait on him (-sheemoosh - attending to the tzadik is the greatest way of gaining his wisdom and holiness) in order to hear the wisdom of his very extremely holy and awesome Torah.

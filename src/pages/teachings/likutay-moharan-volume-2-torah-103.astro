        The mitzvah of giving tzedakah [charity] is very great, for it is compared to lending to Hashem, as it is written: "If you lend money to the poor among My people" (Exodus 22:24), and our Sages, of blessed memory, said: "Whoever gives tzedakah to a poor person is considered as if he lent to the Holy One, blessed is He" (Bava Metzia 75a). And through tzedakah, one merits to have all his needs fulfilled. For when one gives tzedakah, Hashem, blessed is He, rewards him with abundant blessing. And this is the aspect of the mazon [sustenance] that comes from Hashem.
      </p>

      <div class="hebrew-quote">
        מִצְוַת נְתִינַת צְדָקָה
      </div>

      <p>
        And this is also the aspect of the giving of the half-shekel, which was given for the Temple service, as it is written: "This they shall give, everyone who passes through the counting, half a shekel" (Exodus 30:13). And the half-shekel atones for the souls of Yisrael, as our Sages, of blessed memory, said. For through giving tzedakah, one atones for his sins and merits to have a portion in the World to Come. And this is the aspect of the tzedakah fund that is established in every community, to help the poor and the needy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore, one should always be careful to give tzedakah, even if he is poor himself. For giving tzedakah has the power to open the gates of blessing and abundance. And through tzedakah, one merits to have his prayers answered and his needs fulfilled. And this is the aspect of the redemption, for when Yisrael gives tzedakah, the redemption will come. For tzedakah is the key to the redemption, as it is written: "Zion will be redeemed with righteousness" (Isaiah 1:27), and tzedakah is righteousness.

when this man of truth draws to himself the charities then they have
no power the charity and no power in their thought to exist as above.
And what charity is drawn to truth because charity is aspect of truth
(see Zohar Emor 9a) because truth is one because one is only one
because before one what are you counting (Sefer Yetzirah) and if
there is second etc it is not one and similarly the truth is only one
because when they say on some thing the truth it is impossible to say
because if one, that is the truth as it is but lie it is possible to
say on one thing many things (as explained in another place above in
sign 51, see there) because on vessel silver it is impossible to say
the truth because if one that is that it is vessel silver alone but
if he wants to say lie, he can say many because he can say that it is
vessel gold or copper or other names and similarly in all the things
in the world, it is impossible to say the truth because if thing one
as it is but the lie is the many as above it is found that truth is
one (and see there more wondrous things from the matter of truth that
it is one see there) and therefore Holy One blessed be He and Torah
and Israel all one because the Name blessed be He truth and His Torah
truth and Israel truth and since all truth, all one because in truth
there is no change as it is written&nbsp;</font></font></font><font color="#800080"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><b>&quot;I

because the Name blessed be He is truth and He is one without change,
G-d forbid, as above and the change is only with the recipients
because according to the recipient so is formed with him the change
but the Name blessed be He no change in Him, G-d forbid and this
aspect of sun because the sun is only power one alone and the changes
are the many changes are formed through the sun like to melt and to
freeze to cool and to heat and other powers (as explained in another
place) and this is only because of the recipients like when the sun
comes on wax melts it this because the wax is not hard in truth and
therefore is formed with it the power to melt, and similarly in other
powers but the sun is only power one alone and this aspect of
charity, that is aspect of sun aspect of truth as above&nbsp;</font></font></font><font color="#800080"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><b>&quot;And

for through charity come several changes and all is only because of
the recipients but the charity that is aspect of truth aspect of sun
as above is only power one alone, and no change in it as above and
the change is only with the recipients that their faces change to
several colors and there is that his face changes because of
greatness that he has in that he is not worthy that he needs the
creatures and there is because of smallness on that he needs the
creatures and there is that his face changes because of joy, that he
is joyful that they give to him and also in this there are changes
because there is one who is very joyful on that they give to him it
is found that the changes is only with the recipients each one

charity is only power one alone because it is aspect of truth, aspect

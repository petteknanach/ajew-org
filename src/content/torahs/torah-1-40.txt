        Likutay Moharan Volume 1: Torah 40
        “These are the journeys of the children of Yisrael” [Numbers 33:1]
        [In the language of our master, Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, of blessed memory]
        
        It is brought in the holy book Asarah Ma’amaros (Ten Utterances [Kabbalistic work by Rabbi Menachem Azariah da Fano]): “These are the mas’ai (journeys [spiritual movements]) of the children of Yisrael” because they sinned in “these are your gods, Yisrael” [Exodus 32:4]. Because of this, the children of Yisrael shall journey. It emerges that all the nesiyos (journeys) of a person are because of the kilkul ha’emunah (spoiling of faith [lack of trust in G-d]), which is the aspect of avodas alilim (idol worship [service of foreign powers]). For if he believed with complete emunah (faith [spiritual trust in G-d]) that the Holy One, blessed be He, can prepare for him all his needs, he would not journey any nesiyah (journey). It emerges that nesiyah (journey) is a kilkul emunah (spoiling of faith), which is the aspect of avodas alilim (idol worship). And this is what is written regarding avodas alilim (idol worship): “Go out, say to him” [Isaiah 30:22]. “Go out,” this is the aspect of nesiyah (journey) and tiltul (movement [displacement]). Also, through tiltul (movement) [effort to rectify], he rectifies the tiltul (movement) that he caused, [kivyakhol (as if)] above [in the spiritual realms], as it is written: “And the maseikhah (molten image [idol]) is narrow as it gathers” [Isaiah 28:20]. Also, through avodas alilim (idol worship), the matar (rain [divine abundance]) is withheld, as it is written: “And you shall serve other gods, etc., and there shall be no matar (rain)” [Deuteronomy 11:16-17]. And when there is no matar (rain), there is no sava’ah (satiety [abundance]). As it is written: “The mountains shall bear shalom (peace) for the people” [Psalms 72:3], as Rashi explained, then no man helps his fellow. And each one needs to journey and move from place to place for his parnasah (sustenance [livelihood]). Also, golus (exile [dispersion]) comes upon the bittul Torah (negation of Torah [lack of study]), as it is written: “My people are golah (exiled) for lack of da’as (knowledge [Torah wisdom])” [Isaiah 5:13]. And through avodas alilim (idol worship), comes the atziras geshamim (withholding of rains), and when there is no kemach (flour [material sustenance]), there is no Torah [Avot 3:17].

Book of</p>
<p>The
Life of Our Leader Rabbi Nachman</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>"Who
will relate the mighty actions of Hashem, make heard all His praise?"
(Psalms 106). Who can tell over, who can fathom, all the great, and
wondrous, and awesome things done by our master, our teacher, and our
rabbi, light of lights, pure, pristine light, the cached, and hidden,
and concealed light, with the collective entirety of the souls of
Israel, upon whom (/which) are contingent all the worlds. And
especially that which he accomplished and did with his men close to
him who merited to revel in the holy shade of his shadow, and to hear
from his mouth what they heard, matters which Atteek Yoamin
(-Ancient of Days – a Supernal Divine Countenance – Daniel 7:9)
concealed (Pesachim 119a). And particularly, that which he worked and
did with my poor and destitute self, that he erected me from the dust
and the dumps, and sat me down next to him, and with his mercy drew
me even more, close to him, and placed his hand on me (-approbation,
ordination) to receive and to write all his words of Torah, and his
discourses, and his legendary tales. All and everything he merited me
that it should be written by my hand, and he said explicitly (Chuchma
and Beena article 21, and this is a seeming resolution to the query
in Yisroel Saba chapter "Above Nature," that "a little" goes
on Rabbi Nussun as well as Rabbi Naftoli) that there is no one that
knows from him, except for I (-Rabbi Nussun), a little, and many
additional such expressions.</p>
<p>And
in truth, my soul knows very well what is impossible to tell over
whatsoever, and I already wrote a lot, and I told over orally to my
friends and my students a very great deal, and thank G-d my words
made an impact, with his great power, that the truth entered their
hearts like burning fire, and they were aroused plen</parameter>

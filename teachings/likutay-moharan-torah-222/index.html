needs to be always in joy and to serve G-d in joy and even if
sometimes he falls from his level one needs to strengthen himself
with the previous days that there shone for him some illumination a
little as we see that several blind hold themselves with one man who
is not blind and believe in him and go after him and also the blind
believes in his staff that he goes after his staff, even though he
does not see at all nevertheless it is fitting to go after himself
that is after that in the previous days there shone for him a little
and his heart was strengthened and aroused to Hashem, blessed be He,
even though now he fell from this and his eyes and his heart were
closed nevertheless it is fitting that he hold to the previous days
and go after them that is like then his heart was aroused to
strengthen in His service, blessed be He, so also now he should
strengthen his heart very much and go after the arousal and the
shining that he had then even though now he fell from this as above
until in a few days He will help him and He will return and shine for
him His light, blessed be He, amen [see at the end of the book what
relates to this].</font></font></font></p>

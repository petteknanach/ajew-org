that thought possesses immense power. If one strengthens and empowers
his thought toward any matter in the world, he can bring it into
being. Even if he intensely focuses his thought on acquiring wealth,
he will certainly obtain it. The same applies to any matter –
provided the thought involves the nullification of all physical
senses. And the thought is so powerful that it becomes possible to
surrender his soul through it literally. That is, he can feel the
actual pain of death by accepting in his mind that he is willing to
give his soul for the sanctification of the Name in any form of
death.</font></font></font></p>

is possible to strengthen and empower the thought to such an extent
that, at the moment he accepts in his thought that he is willing to
surrender his soul to die for the sanctification of the Name, he
feels the pain of death literally. This is what Rabbi Akiva said
(</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><i>Berachot</i></font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;61b):
&quot;All my days I was distressed over this verse: 'When will it
come to my hand so that I may fulfill it?' Now that it has come, and
I would not fulfill it?&quot; That is, during the recitation of
Shema, when Rabbi Akiva would accept upon himself the four modes of
capital punishment by the court, he would accept the giving of his
soul in such a strong and powerful thought that he would feel
distressed and experience the sufferings of death literally, as if
they were stoning and burning him in actuality, without any
difference.</font></font></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in; background: #ffffff">
<font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">And
this is &quot;all my days I was distressed: when will it come etc.&quot;
– meaning, from what I estimated and accepted in my mind – &quot;when
will it come to my hand and I fulfill it&quot; to surrender my soul
for the sanctification of the Name – from this alone I was
distressed and felt and endured the sufferings of death literally, as
aforementioned. &quot;Now that it has come to my hand in actuality,
and I would not fulfill it?&quot; – for haven't I always endured
this pain literally from the acceptance in thought alone? And when
one strengthens the thought in soul-surrender to this degree as
aforementioned, he can die literally from this pain, as if he were
dying from that death in actuality, for there is no difference
between death in actuality and the pain felt from death in thought,
as aforementioned. Therefore, one must prevent and distance himself
from remaining in that state when he feels that his soul is close to
departing, so that he does not die before his time, G-d forbid.</font></font></font></p>

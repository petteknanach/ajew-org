And his program was: he would regularly go<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>into civilization and enter in [conversation] with some person - typically<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>going in [conversation] with lowly people, such as poor people and so forth - and<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>he would start talking with the person regarding the purpose of the whole<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>world, that truthfully there is no purpose whatsoever in the world except for<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>serving G-d all one's life, spending the years only with prayer to Hashem<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>Yisburach, with song and praises to Hashem Yisburach etc.. And he would speak a<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>lot of such talk with the person to wake him up, until his words entered his<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>heart, until the person would be willing to join him. And as soon as the person<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>agreed with him, he would immediately take him and bring him to his place which<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>he had outside of civilization (i.e. outside of settled places; not where<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>people dwell), for the Prayer Leader had chosen for himself a place outside of<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>civilization, and there was a river [Heb.: before it], as well as trees, and<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>fruits there too, and they would eat of the fruit, and they would not pay<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>attention to clothes whatsoever - how one goes, he goes.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>And so was<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>the constant schedule of the Prayer Leader, going into civilization and<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>persuading people to go his way, to only serve Hashem Yisburach and only be<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>involved with prayers etc.; and who ever listened to him, he would take and<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>bring to his place outside of civilization, as mentioned, and they would be<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>involved there, just with prayers, songs, and praises to Hashem Yisburach, and<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>confessions, fasts, privations (i.e. torturing one's body), repentance, and so<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>forth; and the Prayer Leader would give them his compositions (i.e. books) that<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>he had of prayers, songs, praises, and confessions, and they would be engaged in<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>them constantly, to the extent that there would be found among his people that<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>he brought there, those who could now also bring people to Hashem Yisburach. He<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>would sometimes give permission to one of his people, that he could already now<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>also go into civilization and awaken people to the Almighty, that they should<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>only serve Hashem Yisburach.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>The Prayer<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>Leader kept doing this, all the time drawing his people and taking them out of<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>civilization, as mentioned, until an impression was made on the world, and the<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>thing began to become known, because suddenly people would disappear from the<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>country and no one knew where they went: this one had a missing son, that one<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>had a missing son-in-law, and no one knew where they were, until it became<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>known that there exists a Prayer Leader who goes and talks people into<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>(serving) Hashem Yisburach. Except, catch him they could not, because the<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>Prayer Leader would conduct himself very craftily, and would present himself<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>differently for each person. For this one he presented himself as a poor man,<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>for that one as a trader, and for another he disguised himself still<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>differently. Furthermore, when he would come to talk to a person, when he<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>understood that he could not accomplish with the person what he wanted, he<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>would speak to him in such circuitous talk that it was not possible at all to<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>detect that he meant that - that is, to draw him closer to Hashem Yisburach.<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>And it was impossible to realize that he meant that, even though in truth his<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>whole intention was only that, for, in the things he chatted and talked about<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>with people, he meant nothing other than this, that is, to draw them close to<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>Hashem Yisburach. Only when he understood that he was not influencing him, he<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>would so deceive and misguide him with talk, until the other thought that he<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>did not want that at all. (Therefore they could not catch the Prayer Leader.)<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>The Prayer Leader remained occupied with this matter, until there was an<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>impression and publicity (all) over the world; and they wanted to catch him but<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>it was impossible, as mentioned.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>So the<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>Prayer Leader with his people dwelled outside of civilization, and were<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>involved only with prayer, songs, and praises to Hashem Yisburach, and<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>confessions, fasts, afflictions, and penances. It was also the Prayer Leader's<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>business that he could "suffice" for each person (in other words,<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d> provide for each person) what he needed. If he understood of one of his<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>people that in accordance to his intellect he needed, for serving Hashem, to go<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>dressed in 'gilden geshtik' (gold [-embossed] clothes), he supplied it for him,<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>and vice versa, when sometimes some rich person would draw close to him, and he<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>extracted him from civilization, and he understood that this rich person needed<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>to go in tatters, he would make him go [dressed] that way; whatever way he knew<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>a person needed to go, he supplied it for him. And for the people whom he drew<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>close to Hashem Yisburach, a fast or the biggest privation (i.e. torturing<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>oneself) was dearer than all the world's delights, for they had more delight<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>from the big privation or fast, than from all the delights of the world.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>And the<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>day came to pass, and there was a country where there were enormous riches;<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>they were all rich. Only, their behavior was quite disturbing, because by them,<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>everything went according to wealth; everyone's status and honor was only<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>according to his wealth. It was determined by them, that whoever had a certain<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>amount of money - thousands or ten-thousands - attained one status [Yid.: and<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>this honor]; and whoever had such and such an amount of money attains another<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>status; similarly, all the hierarchy by them, was all according to the money<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>each person had. And he who had so many, so many thousands and ten-thousands,<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>as was determined there by them - is already a king.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>And similarly<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>they had flags, that whoever had so much money is in this banner, and deserves<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>status and honor in that flag; and who ever had so much money, is in another<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>flag, and deserves the status in that pennant, all according to his money. So<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>it was determined for everyone how much money he should have in order to have<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>the status in this flag, and how much money he should have in order to already<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>be in another flag, and have there, some kind of status and honor. And so every<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>man's honor, and all of his status, was all only according to how much money he<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>had, as had been determined by them for every status and honor, how much money<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>he needed to have.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>And<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>similarly it was determined by them, if he has only so much money, he is a<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>plain human, whereas if he has yet less, he is already no man at all, just a<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>beast or bird (i.e. it's just a beast that looks like a human). So they had<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>beasts and birds, that is, if he has this little money, it's just a lion - it's<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>a human lion; but if he has that little money, he is a mere bird. And similarly<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>they had other beasts and birds, for someone who has little money, is no man at<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>all by them, just a beast or a bird. Because the main object for them was<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>money, and the status and honor of everyone, was only according to his money.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>It was<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>heard in the world that there is such a country. The Prayer Leader made a very<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>big sigh over this [Heb: would sigh over this, and would say], and he said,<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>"Who knows how far they can stray through this?" Some men from his<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>people were present, and they did not ask his opinion at all, and they picked<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>up and went to that country to get them out of it. Because they (i.e. the<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>people of the Prayer Leader) had great pity on that country which was so led<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>astray in the craving of money, and especially since the Prayer Leader had said<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>that they could go further astray, therefore these people of the Prayer Leader<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>went to that country; perhaps they could bring them out of their nonsense.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>They<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>entered the country and they approached one of them who was apparently a person<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>of low-status whom they call a beast, and they began to talk with him, that<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>truthfully money is not a purpose at all, and the main purpose is only to<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>service Hashem, and so forth. But he did not listen to them at all, because it<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>was already rooted in their thinking that the main thing is only money. And<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>likewise they chatted with another, and he too did not listen. And they wanted<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>to talk with him more, but he replied, "I have no more time to talk with<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>you."</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>They asked<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>him, "Why?"</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>He<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>replied, "Because we all must leave the country and go to another country,<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>for we have seen that the main goal is only money, therefore it is set by us<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>that we must go to such a country where they make money (i.e. there, there is a<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>kind of earth from which they make gold and silver). Therefore we all must go<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>now to that country."</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>It was<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>also settled by them that they wanted to have stars and constellations too,<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>that is, whoever has so much and so much money, according to the amount they<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>had determined for it, he should be a star, because since he has so much money<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>he must have the power of the star, because the star generates the gold,<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>because the fact that there is earth from which gold is made, is after all, due<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>to the star that generates such earth from which gold is made. Since this man<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>has so much gold, he must have the power of this star, therefore he himself is<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>a star. And likewise they said they wanted to have constellations too. That is,<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>when someone would have so much and so much money, however much they had<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>determined for it, he should be a constellation. And likewise they made for<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>themselves angels, all according to (the amount of) money. Until they agreed<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>that they should have gods too, that whoever would have vast (amounts of)<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>money, so many and so many thousands and myriads, however much they had<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>determined for this, he would be a god, because since G-d gives him so much<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>money, he himself is a god. [Heb: And so they carried out and did everything<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>that was mentioned above].</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>Furthermore<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>they said that they ought not dwell in the air of this world, and they must not<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>at all be together with other people, so that they should not contaminate them,<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>because the other people of the world are completely impure compared to them;<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>therefore they decided that they should find for themselves very high mountains<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>that are higher than the whole world, and they should dwell there, so that they<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>can be higher than the air of the world. They sent people to seek high<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>mountains, and they found very high mountains. The whole country went and<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>settled there on the high mountains, that is, on each mountain a gathering of<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>people from the country (in other words, a city) settled [Yid: and so too on<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>the other mountains etc.]. And around the mountain they made a big<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>fortification and great trenches around the mountain, until it was impossible<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>for any man to reach them, because there was no longer but one hidden path to<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>the mountain, which no other person had any knowledge of, to reach them. And<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>likewise on the next mountain, and so on all the mountains, on all of them they<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>made a fortification etc. as mentioned. And they appointed guards far from the<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>mountain, so no one [Heb: stranger] would be able to come [Heb: close to them].</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>So they<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>dwelled there on the mountains and conducted themselves as mentioned earlier,<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>and they had many gods, that is, according to the money, as mentioned. However,<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>since wealth was the main thing for them - so much so that via great wealth a<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>person could become a god - they were under threat of murder and theft, because<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>anyone would be a murderer or thief in order to become a god via the money he<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>would steal. But they said, since the wealthy one is a god, he will protect<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>himself from theft and murder. And they established devotions and offerings, to<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>bring offerings and pray to the gods to thereby get money, and they would<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>sacrifice people, and would sacrifice their very selves to the gods, in order<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>to be included in them, and later be reincarnated as a rich person. Because<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>their main credence was in money. And they had devotions, sacrifices, and<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>incenses with which they served their gods (i.e. those who had much money). But<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>despite this, the country was certainly full of murder and theft, because<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>whoever did not believe in the devotions became a murder and thief in order to<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>get money, because the main thing for them was wealth, since through money one<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>can buy anything - food and clothing - and the essential life of a man is<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>through money; therefore money was their main creed (such was their foolish and<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>confused thinking). And they all tried to not lose any money, because money was<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>for them the fundamental faith and the god; on the contrary, it was necessary<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>to endeavor to bring money into the country from other places. Traders would<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>embark (from them) to trade in other countries, in order to win money, in order<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>to bring even more money into the country. And charity was certainly a great<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>prohibition for them, because how can someone be permitted to give away the<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>money that G-d has given him - which was for them the main thing, to have money<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>- how can someone be permitted to give that away? Therefore certainly for them<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>it was a prohibition to give to charity.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>And they<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>had officers who were appointed to monitor everyone whether he has as much<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>money as he says, because everyone had to always show off his wealth in order<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>to remain in the status and honor that he had according to his money (in other<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>words, all the rich people who, for them, were gods, stars, angels etc. due to<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>their money, would always be inspected whether he has so much money; whether he<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>is not a god in vain, and so forth, and people were appointed to constantly<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>oversee this). And sometimes by them, an animal would become a person, or a<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>person an animal, namely, when a rich person lost his money he already became a<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>non-human - a man became an animal, because he already had no money for<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>himself; and vice versa when someone won money, so an animal became human; and<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>so on with the other classes, which by them were all according to money (it<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>likewise also happened with someone sometimes becoming a non-god because he had<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>already lost the money). And they would have the figures and portraits of the<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>gods (i.e. those who had much money) and everyone had the portraits, and they<br data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>would hug and kiss them, because money was their entire devotion and faith.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-iax4r57d><em data-astro-cid-iax4r57d>Content continues in original source...</em></p> </div> </div> </section>

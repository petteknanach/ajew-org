<p style="margin-bottom: 0.11in"><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="background: #ffffff">Explanation:
&quot;Vanity&quot; — hevel — signifies the vapor of the mouth
which emerges from the throat in sighs and groans; each person
groaning according to his own measure. As it is said: &quot;The
righteous shall walk in them, but transgressors shall stumble in
them&quot; (Hosea 14:10). There exists a wicked person who groans and
sighs all his life over past deeds. Conversely, God forbid, there
exists a righteous person who, from the beginning, has been upright,
and he too wonders about his beginnings and groans and sighs. Behold,
there are two ropes: one, the rope of holiness, and its opposite, the
rope of impurity. Man has free will: one who sanctifies himself is
bound to the rope of holiness; and, God forbid, one who attaches
himself to the physical and base is bound to the rope of impurity.
And the groan and the sigh — they are in the aspect of death, both
in body and soul. • In the body, as our sages, of blessed memory,
said: &quot;A sigh breaks half a person’s body&quot; (Berakhot
58b). • In the soul, this is also known, as it is written: &quot;You
gather their spirit—they expire&quot; (Psalms 104:29). For before
their death, their spirit is gathered in, and they expire. Likewise,
when a person sighs or groans — if one contemplates and examines
carefully — the sigh travels from deep within to the throat, which
corresponds to &quot;You gather their spirit&quot;, as at that very
moment, an additional spirit is taken, and the person almost expires
and is gathered [i.e., elevated or detached from his previous state].
Thus, if one sighs or groans over the sins in his hands, and he
desires to return in repentance, then in that sigh he expires and is
gathered from the evil that was in his hands — in the manner of:
&quot;You gather their spirit—they expire&quot; (ibid). And
thereby, he attaches to holiness. But likewise — the opposite is
also true: God forbid — if one groans and sighs over the good that
is in his hands, and he desires to cleave to impurity, then the
spirit of holiness expires and departs from him, and instead he
becomes attached to impurity. And this is the meaning of: &quot;There
is a vanity that is done on the earth&quot; — that is, the vapor of
the mouth from a sigh or groan — and there are righteous
individuals who, wondering about the beginning [their earlier
spiritual state], sigh — and the vapor that leaves their mouth
returns to them as if it were the deeds of the wicked, for they have
inadvertently connected to the side of impurity. And similarly, there
are wicked people who sigh and groan, and the vapor that leaves their
mouth returns to them as if it were the deeds of the righteous, for
they are cut off from impurity and instead attach to holiness.
Summary Principle: Each person must draw his vitality from one of the
two ropes. The moment one is cut off from one, he is automatically
attached to the other. Therefore, it is good to habituate oneself to
sigh over his unworthy deeds, to long and to yearn — with the force
of that sigh — to return to the Blessed Name. For by doing so, he
is cut off from the rope of impurity, and bound to the rope of
holiness, as explained above.
________________________________________ Additionally, I found in the
writings of the companions a further explanation of this matter,
which elaborates on the greatness of the value of a holy sigh, for
they wrote that: A sigh that one sighs over his sins, or over the
smallness of his spiritual attainment, is greater than many fasts and
mortifications. For through fasting, one breaks only the body — but
with a sigh, he breaks the entire body, and also exchanges his soul
and his vitality from evil to good. For a person’s breath/vapor is
the rope which connects the soul to its source — whether for good,
or, God forbid, for the opposite. And when he sighs, it is in the
manner of: &quot;You gather their spirit—they expire&quot; (Psalms
104:29). Thus, he becomes cut off from the rope he was initially tied
to, and becomes connected to another rope — in accordance with the
nature and direction of the sigh, as explained.</span></font></font></font></p>

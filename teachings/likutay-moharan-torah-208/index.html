[Psalms 37] Interpretation: What the wicked do sufferings to tzadikim
and pursue the tzadikim this is a cause from Hashem, blessed be He,
in order that the tzadik should contemplate and search his deeds, it
is found that the wicked is like a watchman like a guard of the city
that is called watchman, so the wicked is guarding the tzadik from
falling in physicality. Another interpretation, the little
controversy that there is on tzadikim is good for them because the
controversy is like a cover for them that they should not be revealed
and publicized more than necessary, and this is the interpretation
&quot;the wicked watches the tzadik&quot; watches in the language of
cover as it is written&nbsp;</font></font></font><font color="#0000ff"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>&quot;And

25] but those wicked increase in controversy, increase in cover until
that there is no strength in the tzadikim to bear their controversy
and their hatred of the wicked, and this is: &quot;and seeks to kill
him&quot; like they cover a person from his head to his feet until
that it is impossible for him to breathe, so those wicked cover and
increase in coverings in controversy and seek to kill him, but &quot;and
G-d will not leave him in his hand&quot;.</font></font></font></p>

toil and exertion in the service of Hashem Yisburach with supremely
powerful messeeras nefesh (-self sacrifice), from his
childhood days until his passing, until he merited to live true life,
life which is truly called life. And it will relate a little of what
transpired over him in his holy life, and a little of his holy words
which were heard from his holy mouth, and the times that passed over
him, as your eyes will see straight out.</p>

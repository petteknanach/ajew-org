  <p>32 - My Lord, Open My Lips</p>
  <p>[Note from English translator: This Torah explores the rectification of the kallah [bride] through rikkudin [dances], sweetening dinim [judgments] via Binah [understanding] and lev [heart], aligning with A-donai [divine name] and the spiritual pairing of the wedding.]</p>
  <p>[In the language of our rabbi, of blessed memory] A-donai, open my lips (Psalms 51:17). This is the aspect of rikkudin [dances] of the wedding. For as long as she is not given to zivug [pairing], she is called na’ar [maiden, without the Hebrew letter hay] [Zohar Ba 38a], gematria shach [320 - ש"ך, numerical value], dinim [judgments]. When she is rectified for zivug [pairing], she is called na’ara [maiden, with the Hebrew letter hay added to transform na’ar (נַעַר, gematria 320, representing dinim [judgments]) into na’ara (נַעֲרָה, gematria 325, sweetened by the divine light of Eh-HehYeh [divine name] in Binah [understanding])], for the dinim [judgments] are sweetened by means of the hay [Hebrew letter hay, numerical value 5] alfin [Alefs - the first Hebrew letter] of Eh-HehYeh [divine name] that are in Binah [understanding] [see Pri Etz Chaim, Gate of Standing Prayer]. Thus, the kallah [bride] is still in the aspect of na’ar [maiden, without hay], in the aspect of shach [320 - ש"ך], dinim [judgments]. One needs to sweeten and rectify her. This is done by means of rikkudin [dances], for the raglin [feet] are in the aspect of Netzach [victory] and Hod [splendor] [Patah Eliyahu]. They are elevated through the joy of the lev [heart], as seen in sense: Through the joy of the lev [heart], they dance, as it is written regarding Jacob (Genesis 29:1): And Jacob lifted his feet. Rashi [rabbinic commentator] explained: His lev [heart] lifted his raglin [feet]. The lev [heart] is Binah [understanding], as it is written [Patah Eliyahu]: Binah libba [understanding heart], and in it, the lev [heart] understands. Therefore, one needs to intend in the rikkudin [dances] to draw the alfin [thousands] in the lev [heart] through the raglin [feet] to the kallah [bride], who is the aspect of five times din [judgment], gematria shach [320], gematria na’ar [maiden, without hay]. Through the light of the lev [heart] that is drawn to her, she becomes a na’ara [maiden, with the Hebrew letter hay added to transform na’ar (נַעַר, gematria 320, representing dinim [judgments] = 5 times 'din') into na’ara (נַעֲרָה, gematria 325, sweetened by the divine light of Eh-HehYeh [divine name] in Binah [understanding])] and is made five times A-donai [divine name, this Name is the letters 'din' with an extra Alef]. This is the aspect of: A-donai, open my lips. For through the lips, which are Netzach [victory] and Hod [splendor], the kallah [bride] is opened and sweetened in the aspect of zivug [pairing] and becomes the aspect of A-donai [divine name], that she is a na’ara [maiden, with hay], worthy for zivug [pairing]. This is what is in the Midrash (Beraishis parasha 70): When Jacob married Leah, at the hour that they were dancing, they were singing Hu Laya [This is Leah, a song hinting at the revelation of the hidden world]. To hint to Jacob: Here is Leah [Zohar Vayetze 154a]. That is, for Leah is the alma de’itkasia [hidden world], which is the aspect of lev [heart], as it is written (Psalms 119:11): In my heart I hid Your saying. From there is the sweetening of the dinim [judgments] when they draw the hay [Hebrew letter hay] from the lev [heart]. This is Hu Laya [This is Leah], that one needs to draw from Leah the alfin [the 5 Alefs of Bina] to sweeten and rectify the kallah [bride]. Also, they were saying that the kallah [bride], her name is Leah, that through aspects of herself, she is sweetened.</p>

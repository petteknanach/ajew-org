FREEDOM - LIBERTY - EMANCIPATION Tuesday, July 22, 2025 Likutay Moharan - Torah-teaching 66 Likutay Moharan 66 66 - Let There Be Double of Your Spirit Upon Me ( ויהי נא פי שנים ברוחך אלי - The Transmission of Spirit) "Let there be double of your spirit upon me," and he said etc., "if you see me taken from you, it shall be so for you" etc. [2 Kings 2:9-10] And behold, it was fulfilled afterward in Elisha double, it is found that Elisha prayed with greater intention than Elijah his master, for all the miracles and great deeds that Elisha did, all were through prayer, as our sages said, may their memory be for blessing (Megillah 27a) on the verse: "Tell me now all the great deeds that Elisha did." [Note: This teaching explores the spiritual transmission from teacher to student and the power of truth in prayer.] 1. Know, that it is possible that the student be greater than the teacher, that is, that he have double ( pi shenayim [-double portion]) than his teacher, and even so, all will be through the power of his teacher, and this is the aspect of: "Let there be double of your spirit upon me," in your spirit specifically, that through the aspect of the spirit itself of Elijah his teacher, he will have double like him. For it is stated, that the tzadik [-righteous one] has the aspect of two spirits, a higher spirit ( ruach le&#8217;ela [-upper spirit]), a lower spirit ( ruach letata [-lower spirit]), "These are the generations of Noah, Noah" [Genesis 6:9], Noah above, Noah below [as written there in Zohar (Noah page 59b on this verse, see there in Tosefta), and this is its language: Why Noah twice, but every tzadik and tzadik in the world has two spirits, one spirit in this world, and one spirit in the world to come, and so you will find in all the righteous etc., see there] [ Correlation: Two mentions of Noah reflect the dual spiritual vitality of the tzadik . ], that is, he has the aspect of vitality above, and vitality below, and the spirit and vitality above is very, very great, and the students are with the tzadik from one root [ shoresh ], only they are dependent on him like branches on a tree, that the tree draws its vitality from its root [ shoresh ], and the branches draw the vitality through the tree, and there are several aspects in this, for there are students who are in the aspect of branches, and there are those who are in the aspect of leaves, and similarly other aspects. And at the time of the departure ( histalkut [-ascension or passing of the tzadik ]) of the tzadik , then he attains much more than he attained in his lifetime, each one according to his level, as we found with Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai in the Idra, and with our holy Rebbe, and with other righteous ones. And know, that this is through that at the time of departure, then the aspect of the higher spirit and vitality descends and comes below, and then the lower spirit unites and joins together with the higher spirit, for in truth, they are one, and immediately when they are revealed to each other, they unite greatly in great unity, and because the higher spirit cannot be in this world, for its nature cannot bear this world at all, therefore it ascends above, and through this the tzadik departs, for when the higher spirit ascends, the lower spirit ascends with it because they united greatly in great unity as above. And therefore, it is a very great thing to be at the time of the departure of the tzadik , even for one who is not his student, for because then the higher spirit descends and is revealed below, it is found that a very great illumination is revealed then, therefore it is a great good for all who are there then, and it is a good for them for length of days (Chagigah 5b): on the verse "And he shall live forever etc., for he sees the wise die" [Psalms 49:10]. But for the students, a very great illumination reaches them then even more, for because they are dependent on the tzadik , and draw from one root [ shoresh ], it is found that this higher vitality is their very vitality, and they unite and embrace also with this spirit in great unity, for it is their spirit and vitality literally as above. And through this, if he merits, he can receive double, for the tzadik who reached his time to depart from the world departs through this, through that he draws with him the higher spirit the lower spirit, and the students receive double through this, for the aspect of the higher spirit remains with them because it united greatly with the lower spirit as above. But there are several aspects in students, and one who is very connected to the tzadik like branches on a tree literally, that is, that he feels in himself all the ascents and descents that the tzadik has, even though he is not with the tzadik , for it is proper for the student to feel in himself all the ascents and descents of the tzadik if he is truly connected as proper like branches on a tree, for the branches feel all the ascents and descents that the tree has, for the tree draws its vitality from its root [ shoresh ] through the channels that are in it, that it draws through them its vitality from its root [ shoresh ], that is, that it has hollows through which it draws its vitality, and through this in the winter when the moisture dries up and the hollows contract, through this all the branches contract, and because of this the leaves fall then, and similarly the opposite in the summer as above. And one who is connected to the tzadik similarly, that is, that he feels all the ascents and descents of the tzadik , for there are many, many aspects of ascents and descents, for there are aspects of the departure of the soul, and there is the departure of the Name, which is also the aspect of departure, for the Name is the soul, as explained elsewhere [below in Torah 260], that this is the aspect of giving over the soul literally, see there, and there is the departure from level to level, which is also the aspect of departure, and the student who is so connected that he feels in himself all the ascents and descents of his teacher, then he can merit double at the time of the departure as above. And this is the aspect of "If you see me taken from you," that is, that you see me taken and departing, from you specifically, that is, that from you and from yourself you feel the departure as above, and then you will merit double at the time of the departure as above, for at every time of the departure in whichever aspect it is, then it is the aspect of the descent and revelation of the higher spirit in the aspect of the departure above, and at the time of the complete departure, it descends and is revealed completely as above. And this is the aspect of greeting the face of the teacher ( hakbalat penei rabbo [-receiving the presence of the teacher]), that one needs to strive always to greet the face of his teacher, for perhaps now is the time of the aspect of departure, and if he merits, he will receive then a great illumination, in the aspect of double as above. And when he receives double, then it is possible that he pray with intention, and perform deeds and charities more than his teacher, and all through the aspect of the spirit of his teacher, in the aspect of: "Let there be double of your spirit upon me," in your spirit specifically as above [ and one who does not know this, does not know what is the left hand, for the left hand is a matter of innovation ]. 2. For before they bring out from potential to actual, then the potential and the actual are connected together, and t

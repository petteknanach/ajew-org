FREEDOM - LIBERTY - EMANCIPATION Tuesday, July 22, 2025 Likutay Moharan - Torah-teaching 74 74 Be exalted above the heavens, G-d, above all the earth Your glory Be exalted above the heavens, G-d, above all the earth Your glory [Tehillim 57:6] [In the language of the companions] Behold, every person must effect healing for his soul, that is, to raise it to the place of its root [ Zohar Pekudei 223b ]. And with what? Behold, there are two kinds of judgments: judgment of defilement, the aspect of the serpent that injected filth into Chava [ Shabbas 146a , Mishlei 3:18 ], and dina kadisha [ holy judgment ], as it is written: "Whom Hashem loves, He reproves" [Mishlei 3:12]. And the beginning of approaching is distancing, as our Sages said, of blessed memory: Whoever justifies himself below, they justify the judgment upon him above [ Taanis 8a ]. And this is the aspect of small intellect, and it is the aspect of "Avraham begot Yitzchak" [Bereishis 25:19], for Avraham is chesed [ kindness ], and Yitzchak is gevura [ strength ], "fear of Yitzchak" [Bereishis 31:42], as it is written: "In strengths, the salvation of His right hand" [Tehillim 20:7]. And this is what is said: "For His kindness has overwhelmed us" [Tehillim 117:2]. And this is because Yitzchak is the aspect of G-d, as it is written: "Laughter G-d has made for me" [Bereishis 21:6]. And he comes from the aspect of Sarah, the attribute of Malchus [ kingship ], as Rashi explained: that she is called Sarah because she ruled over all the world [ Bereishis 17:15 , Berachos 13a ]. And judgment of kingship is judgment [ Gittin 10b , Tikkunei Zohar 17 ]: righteousness, holy kingship, as it is written: "And Malki Tzedek, king of Shalem" [Bereishis 14:18]. And this is the aspect of smallness [ Bereishis 27:1 ], and it is the aspect of darkness [ Bereishis 1:2 ], and it is the aspect of the soul, as it is written: "My soul desires You in the night" [Yeshayahu 26:9] [ Zohar Lech Lecha 83a ]. And every person must go from smallness to greatness. And when he comes to greatness, it is the aspect of "And the eyes of both were opened" [Bereishis 3:7], and Rashi explained: on the name of chachma [ wisdom ] it was said. As it is written: "And G-d saw the light that it was good" [Bereishis 1:4], and there is no good but Torah [ Scripture ] [ Berachos 8a ]. And these two aspects are the aspects of Hoshana Rabba [ Great Hoshana ] and Simchas Torah [ Rejoicing of the Torah ], which are the aspects of Yitzchak and Yaakov. For Hoshana Rabba is the aspect of speech without knowledge, and it is the aspect of willow, for willow resembles lips [ Tanchuma Emor , Zohar Tzav 32a , Zohar Pinchas 256a ]. As it is stated in the holy Zohar: There is one who studies in the Torah and stammers in it with stammering, that he does not know every word, and that word ascends above, and the Holy One, Blessed be He, rejoices in that word and receives it and plants branches of that stream, and great trees are made from those words, and they are called willows of the stream [ Zohar Kedoshim 85b ]. And Simchas Torah is the aspect of speech with knowledge, and it is the vitality of the soul, as it is written in the Zohar: Fortunate are those who know the ways of the Torah and strive in it in a straight path, for they plant the tree of life above, all of which is healing, as it is written: "Sun of righteousness and healing in its wings" [Malachi 3:20]. For the sun is the aspect of Yaakov, the aspect of speech with knowledge, and it is the aspect of the tree of healing. And this is the statement of the verse: "Sun and shield, Hashem G-d" [Tehillim 84:12] [ Zohar Bereishis 20a , Zohar Pekudei 224b , Tikkunei Zohar Introduction ]. For the aspects of Yitzchak and Yaakov are the aspects of judgment and rachamim [ mercy ], as it is written: "And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun" [Yeshayahu 30:26], for the moon is the aspect of Yitzchak [ Midrash Rabba Bereishis 82 ], and the sun is the aspect of Yaakov [ Midrash Rabba Vayeitzei 68 ]. And a sign that a person may know whether he is in the aspect of judgment of defilement or in the aspect of dina kadisha , the sign of the matter is tefillah [ prayer ] when there is no nullification of prayer, as our Sages said, of blessed memory: Which are sufferings of love? Any that have no nullification of prayer, as it is said: "Blessed is Hashem who did not remove my prayer and His kindness from me" [Tehillim 66:20]. And tefillah is the aspect of face, as it is written: "And Chizkiyahu turned his face and prayed" [Yeshayahu 38:2]. And this is what is written: "You hid Your face, I was dismayed" [Tehillim 30:8]. And this is what Rashi explained: Because the scoffers of the generation were saying, from Avimelech Sarah became pregnant, the aspect of the side of defilement. And G-d formed the countenance of Yitzchak similar to Avraham, and all admitted that "Avraham begot Yitzchak" [Bereishis 25:19], meaning that the judgment is the aspect of dina kadisha and from the side of Avraham, the aspect of chesed , Yitzchak was born. And in this aspect of judgment, which is the soul, there are two aspects: Yaakov, he is the speech, and the aspect of Esav, he is the dross, and it is the aspect of "A soul when it sins" [Vayikra 5:1]. And this is what Rashi explained: "These are the generations of Yitzchak son of Avraham" [Bereishis 25:19], Yaakov and Esav. And when he comes to the aspect of Yaakov, he is chachma , as it is written: "And he supplanted me these two times" [Bereishis 27:36], and Onkelos translated: and he made me wise. Then the aspect of the soul is healed, as it is written: "Sun of righteousness and healing in its wings" . And this is what is written: "The Torah of Hashem is perfect, restoring the soul" [Tehillim 19:8]. And speech without knowledge is called tzedek [ righteousness ], as it is written: "Righteousness you shall speak" [Tehillim 58:2]. And when he comes to the aspect of Yaakov, it is chachma , it is called tzedaka [ charity ], and this is the explanation of the verse: "I who speak in charity, mighty to save" [Yeshayahu 63:1]. That is, the soul that was previously without knowledge is saved by means of tzedaka , which is the aspect of speech with knowledge. And this is the explanation of the verse: "Healing it shall be to your navel" [Mishlei 3:8], which is the attribute of Malchus . And when he comes to the aspect of chachma , the soul is rectified, and he raises it to its root. For the drop of the seed of the birth of the soul is drawn from the brain, and the brain is chachma [ Tikkunei Zohar, Petach Eliyahu ]. And Yisroel ascended in thought first, and thought is chachma , which is the root of the souls of Yisroel and the root of all the worlds, for the root of all is the wisdom of the Torah . For with the Torah the Holy One, Blessed be He, created worlds, and the Torah is called chachma , as it is written: "I am wisdom" [Mishlei 8:12] [ Bereishis Rabba 1:1 ]. And when the soul merits to the wisdom of the Torah , this is the aspect of the renewal of the world, for the renewal of all the worlds was by means of chachma , which is the Torah . And then, when he merits to chachma , then His glory is revealed, which is the main purpose of all the services of man. For the purpose of all the services that man must serve the Creator, blessed be He, is only that His glory be revealed, as it is written: "For My glory I created it" [Yeshayahu 43:7]. And the glory is revealed by means of chachma , as it is written: "And if I am a father, </p>

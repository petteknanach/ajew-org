that one needs to judge every person to the scale of merit and even
who is wicked completely needs to search and find in him some little
good that in that little is not wicked. Through this, that finds in
him little good and judges him to the scale of merit, it raises him
in truth to the scale of merit and can return him to repentance.</font></font></font></p>

aspect &quot;and yet little and no wicked and contemplated on his
place and not he&quot; warns to judge all to the scale of merit. Even
if you see that he is completely wicked, you still need to search and
seek to find in him a little good where he is not wicked. Because how
is it possible that there is no little good in him? Because how is it
possible that he did not do some mitzvah or good thing in his days?</font></font></font></p>

this, when you find in him yet little good where he is not wicked and
judge him to the scale of merit, you take him out in truth from the
scale of guilt to the scale of merit until he returns in repentance.
This &quot;and yet little and no wicked&quot; means finding in the
wicked yet little good that is not wicked.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#222222"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">As
above, understand that a person needs to find also in himself some
little good. Because it is known that a person needs to be very
careful to be in joy always and to distance sadness very much (as
explained with us several times).</font></font></font></p>

when one begins to gaze in himself and sees no good in him and he is
full of sins and wants the Master to make him fall through sadness
and black bile, God forbid — with all this it is forbidden for him
to fall. He only needs to search and find in himself some little
good. Because how is it possible that he did not do some mitzvah or
good thing in his days?</font></font></font></p>

though when he begins to gaze at the good thing he sees that he is
also full of wounds, seeing that even the mitzvah and the holy thing
he merited to do is also full of turnings, foreign thoughts, and many
defects, still how is it possible that in that mitzvah and holy thing
there is no little good? Because in every aspect he was some good
point in the mitzvah and good thing he did.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#222222"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Because
a person needs to search and seek to find in himself some little good
to revive himself and come to joy, as above. Through this searching
and finding in himself still little good, he goes out in truth from
scale guilt to scale merit and can return in repentance in the aspect
&quot;and yet little and no wicked and contemplated on his place and
not he&quot; as above.</font></font></font></p>

is, one needs to judge others to the scale of merit, even the wicked,

them out from scale guilt to scale merit in the aspect &quot;and yet
little...&quot; and &quot;contemplated...&quot;.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#222222"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Similarly,
for a person in himself, he needs to judge himself to the scale of
merit and find in himself some good point to strengthen himself not
to fall completely, God forbid. On the contrary, he will revive
himself and gladden his soul in the little good that he finds in
himself — that is what he merited to do in his days, some mitzvah
or good thing.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; background: #f9f9f9">
<font color="#222222"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Similarly,
he needs to search and find still some good in himself, and even
though that good thing is mixed with much waste, he will still take
some good point from there. So he will gather still the good points
and through this make melodies, as explained elsewhere.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; background: #f9f9f9">
<font color="#222222"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Through
this, he does not let himself fall and revives himself by searching,
seeking, and finding in himself some good points, gathering and
clarifying these good points from within the bad and waste in him.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; background: #f9f9f9">
<font color="#222222"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Through
this he makes melodies and then can pray, sing, and thank Hashem from
his corporeality and his deeds, even though he sees that he is far
from holiness in truth.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; background: #f9f9f9">
<font color="#222222"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">When
revived and gladdened by his own words, even though he knows he has
many bad deeds and sins and is very far from the Name blessed be He,
he still searches and finds some good points in himself and revives
and gladdens himself. Certainly it is fitting for a person to enlarge
his joy very much in every good point from the holiness of Israel
that he finds in himself.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; background: #f9f9f9">
<font color="#222222"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Then,
when he revives and gladdens himself, he can pray, sing, and thank
Hashem. This aspect &quot;I will sing to my God in my stillness&quot;
is precisely through the aspect of &quot;my stillness&quot; that I
find in myself, the aspect &quot;still little and no wicked&quot;, as
above. Through this point, one can sing and thank Hashem.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#222222"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">[Our
Rabbi warned strongly to follow this Torah, because it is a great
foundation for all who want to approach the Name blessed be He and
not to lose their world completely, God forbid. Many people far from
the Name blessed be He mainly are distant from Him because of black
bile and sadness; because of that they fall into despair and see in
themselves great spoilage, their deeds spoiled, and despair
completely. Because of this, they do not pray with intention at all
and do not do even what they could still do.</font></font></font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.17in; background: #f9f9f9">
<font color="#222222"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Therefore
a person needs to be very wise about this because all the falls of
mind, even though from bad deeds he did, with all this, the fall of
mind and the sadness and black bile that fall on him is all by the
master of evil, who weakens his mind to cause him to fall completely,
God forbid.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#222222"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Therefore,
one needs to strengthen greatly and walk with this Torah — to
search and seek in himself always some little good and good points,
etc. Through this he will revive and gladden himself and expect
salvation, and can pray, sing, and thank Hashem — the aspect &quot;I
will sing to my God in my stillness&quot; — and by this merit to
return to Him in truth.]</font></font></font></p>

that whoever can make these melodies — that is, gather the good
points found in all Israel, even in the sinners — he can pray
before the amud (the prayer leader's platform), because he who prays
before the amud is called shaliach tzibur (prayer leader) and needs
to be sent by all the public. That is, he needs to gather all good
points found in all the prayer-ers, and all the good points will be
included in him. He will stand and pray with all this good. This is
the shaliach tzibur.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#222222"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">He
needs to have such a high level that through this all the points will
desire him and be included in him. Whoever can make these melodies
can be chazan and shaliach tzibur to pray before the amud.</font></font></font></p>

know all this, that to know all tzadikim (righteous ones) and which
infants belong to them and how they receive from them — and all the
aspects there — and the generation that will come from them until
the end, to know who can make these melodies is to know all this.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#222222"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">This
is the secret what our rabbis said in the Mishnah (Shabbat 11): the
chazan sees where the infants read the chazan — that is, who can
make these melodies can be chazan and shaliach tzibur to pray before
the amud, seeing and knowing where the infants read, i.e., from which
tzadik they receive their breath and mouth through him read and enter
in the Torah.]</font></font></font></p>

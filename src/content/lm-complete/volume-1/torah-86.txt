FREEDOM - LIBERTY - EMANCIPATION Tuesday, July 22, 2025 Likutay Moharan - Torah-teaching 86 86 One steps in it a small step [In the language of the ḥaverim (friends)]: One steps in it a small step, one dines in it to bless three times, etc. Behold, it is known that during the weekdays, there is the dominion of the ḥitzonim [the "external forces" &#8212; i.e., spiritual impediments, destructive influences]. However, on Erev Shabbat (Friday afternoon), during bein ha-shmashot [twilight, between sunset and nightfall], they have no dominion at all, as brought in the holy Zohar : "When the day is sanctified, then 'All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered'" [Psalms 92:10]. And the primary dominion of the ḥitzonim during the weekdays is through the aspect of the feet "These knees of the Rabbis &#8212; from where are they worn out?" [i.e., from their walking and exertion in spiritual service]. But on Shabbat Kodesh [the holy Sabbath], the power of walking is returned to them, as it is written: "If you restrain your foot because of the Shabbat..." [Isaiah 58:13] &#8212; that is, as we said: on Shabbat, a person is able to walk in the ways of the Blessed Name. However, it is like a child who is first learning to walk &#8212; he still needs sa'ad [support] to hold him up. And even so, he cannot yet run, but only takes small steps. And they must strengthen him. Similarly, when a person begins on Shabbat to walk in the ways of the Blessed Name, he still requires support to hold him. And this support is the aspect of emet [truth]. And this aspect of emet is the aspect of the third leg &#8212; as it says in the Gemara (Shabbat 104a): "Kushta ka&#8217;i" &#8212; "Truth stands." And Shabbat itself is the aspect of emet [truth], as is stated in Masekhet Demai (Chapter 4): "Even an am ha&#8217;aretz [unlearned person] is afraid to lie on Shabbat." And when a person binds himself to this quality [of truth], it serves as support for him &#8212; the aspect of the third leg. But still, one must bless the three aforementioned legs and give them strength, so that they can walk properly. And this is accomplished through tzedakah [charity] given on Shabbat &#8212; that is, giving to a person in honor of Shabbat, or hosting a poor person at one&#8217;s table. For there are two kinds of tzedakah : tzedakah given on weekdays, and tzedakah given on Shabbat Kodesh. And tzedakah is the aspect of shemesh [sun], as it is written: "Shemesh tzedakah" &#8212; &#8220;The sun of righteousness&#8221; [Malachi 3:20 (Hebrew) / 4:2 (English)]. The tzedakah done during the weekdays corresponds to the current sun &#8212; the sun of this time. But the tzedakah of Shabbat, which is a semblance of Olam HaBa [the World to Come], corresponds to the sun that is destined to be renewed in the future &#8212; which is like the light of the seven days [of creation]. And this sun, which is the aspect of tzedakah, is what gives strength to the aspect of the legs, as it is written: "Tzedek lefanav yehalekh" &#8212; &#8220;Righteousness shall go before Him&#8221; [Psalms 85:14]. That is: tzedakah enables walking. And it is written: "Vayizrach lo ha-shemesh" &#8212; &#8220;And the sun rose for him&#8221; [Genesis 32:32]. And Rashi explains: &#8220;For him &#8212; for his need, to heal him from his limp.&#8221; Thus, tzedakah on Shabbat &#8212; which is the aspect of the sun, like the light of the seven days &#8212; gives strength to the three legs mentioned above. And this is the explanation of the phrase: "One steps in it a small step" &#8212; that is, on Shabbat one is still only stepping a small step, as described above. "One dines in it" &#8212; that is, through the aspect of Shabbat, which is the aspect of emet [truth], he makes for himself support &#8212; the third leg. "To bless three times" &#8212; these are the three aforementioned legs &#8212; and one must give them strength so they can walk properly. And this is accomplished through: "Tzidkatam tatzihir ke&#8217;or shivat ha-yamim" &#8212; &#8220;[Their] righteousness will shine like the light of the seven days&#8221; [see reference to Malachi above], that is: through giving tzedakah on Shabbat, which is the aspect of the sun destined to be renewed &#8212; like the light of the seven days, as above.

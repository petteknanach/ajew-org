FREEDOM - LIBERTY - EMANCIPATION Tuesday, July 22, 2025 Likutay Moharan - Torah-teaching 75 Likutay Moharan, Torah 75 Y&#8217;vorchenu Elokim, v&#8217;yir&#8217;u oso kol afsei aretz [May He bless us, G-d, and they shall fear Him, all the ends of the earth] [ Psalms 67:8] [In the language of the companions] Behold, there is the attribute ( midas ) of victory , controversy , and war , arising from bloods ( damim [-vital forces]) not yet used to serve Hashem , Blessed be He , as it is written, &#8220;And their victory shall be sprinkled&#8221; [ Isaiah 63:1], which Rashi explains as bloods . The Holy One, Blessed be He , found no vessel ( kli ) to hold blessing ( bracha ) for Israel except shalom ( peace ) [ Ukzin , Chapter 3]. In controversy , there is the aspect of the maker of shalom , which is the raising of female waters ( ha&#8217;ala&#8217;as mayin nukvin [-spiritual arousal from below]). For example, when a question ( kushya ) arises, it is controversy . The answer ( terutz ) is the maker of shalom , raising mayin nukvin . Sometimes, shalom fosters shalom in another place ( makom ), raising mayin nukvin elsewhere. Torah and prayer ( tefillah ) also raise mayin nukvin , embodying shalom , as it is written, &#8220;Creator of the utterance of lips, peace&#8221; [ Isaiah 57:19], and &#8220;Maker of peace and Creator of all&#8221; [ Isaiah 45:7]. At creation ( briyah ), worlds ( olamot ) fell below through breaking of the vessels ( sheviras hakeilim [-Kabbalistic concept where divine vessels shattered, scattering holiness]), and these worlds , which are letters ( osios ), dispersed into many sparks ( nitzotzos ). Through ha&#8217;ala&#8217;as mayin nukvin via Torah and tefillah , these nitzotzos achieve combination ( tzeiruf ), forming a world ( olam ), which is shalom , as it is written, &#8220;And I will give peace in the land&#8221; [ Leviticus 26:6]. From the earthliness ( artziyus ), the nitzotzos are elevated, creating shalom . This is, &#8220;And to say to Zion, You are My people&#8221; [ Isaiah 52:7]&#8212;read not ami ( My people ) but imi ( with Me ), in My partnership ( shutafus ) [ Introduction to Zohar , 5a]. As Hashem , Blessed be He , creates heavens and earth ( shamayim v&#8217;aretz ) through His utterance ( milul ), so do we through Torah and tefillah . This occurs daily until the coming of Mashiach ( Messiah ), until, &#8220;And His feet shall stand on that day on the Mount of Olives&#8221; [ Zechariah 14:4], an aspect of feet ( raglin ), per the Ari , of blessed memory. Torah and tefillah are aspects of standing ( amida ), tied to raglin . For Torah , it is written, &#8220;And you here stand with Me&#8221; [ Deuteronomy 5:28], and &#8220;And they stood at the foot of the mountain&#8221; [ Exodus 19:17]. For tefillah , &#8220;And Pinchas stood and prayed&#8221; [ Psalms 106:30]. Through the raglin of Torah and tefillah , one draws near to, &#8220;And His feet shall stand on the Mount of Olives&#8221; , as it is written, &#8220;Righteousness shall go before Him&#8221; [ Psalms 85:14]. Righteousness ( tzedek ) is the speech ( dibbur ) of Torah and tefillah , as it is written, &#8220;Righteousness you shall speak&#8221; [ Psalms 58:2]. [ Shuta d&#8217;inuka (partnership of the child) in the thigh ( shok ) of its father and mother [ Sukkah 56a] is not fully understood here.] Before rectification ( tikkun ), nitzotzos not brought into holy dibbur are in the aspect of, &#8220;Limping on his thigh&#8221; [ Genesis 32:32], a defect ( p&#8217;gam ) of raglin . When brought into holy dibbur , it is, &#8220;And He built the rib&#8221; [ Genesis 2:22], rectifying the p&#8217;gam . Before dibbur , nitzotzos lack tzeiruf and connection ( chibur ), existing in brokenness ( shevarim ) and controversy . Through holy dibbur , they achieve tzeiruf , creating shalom . Thus, one must speak only words of Torah ( divrei Torah ) and tefillah , not other things ( d&#8217;varim acheirim ). The Gemara [ Sukkah 53a, Taanis 25a] states: Levi hurled words ( hitiach d&#8217;varim ) upward and became lame, reflecting, &#8220;Limping on his thigh&#8221; , as his non-holy dibbur left him with a p&#8217;gam . One must speak Torah or tefillah until the body ( guf ) becomes null and void ( batel v&#8217;efes ), as in, &#8220;And they shall be one flesh&#8221; [ Genesis 2:24], uniting the guf with dibbur , as it is written, &#8220;And night to night declares&#8221; [ Psalms 19:3] [see Likutay Moharan , Sign 19, Letter 3; Likutay Torah , Sign 82]. This is the rib ( tzela ), where &#8220;And He built the rib&#8221; means the guf is nullified through holy dibbur . This nullification requires fear ( yirah ), as our Sages said [ Bava Basra 10a]: &#8220;A hard body, fear breaks it&#8221; . Fear ( pachad ) is Fear of Yitzchak ( Pachad Yitzchak ) [ Genesis 31:42], meaning yirah . Thus, &#8220; Y&#8217;vorchenu Elokim, v&#8217;yir&#8217;u oso &#8221; [May He bless us, G-d, and they shall fear Him] means bracha , which is shalom , comes through yirah , nullifying the guf via Torah and tefillah . &#8220; Kol afsei aretz &#8221; [all the ends of the earth] signifies all earthliness ( artziyus ) becoming void and nothing ( efes v&#8217;ayin ), enabling bracha through shalom . [Again, it is written]: &#8220; Y&#8217;vorchenu Elokim, v&#8217;yir&#8217;u oso kol afsei aretz &#8221; [May He bless us, G-d, and they shall fear Him, all the ends of the earth]. The attribute of victory , controversy , and war arises from damim not yet used to serve Hashem , Blessed be He , as it is written, &#8220;And their victory shall be sprinkled&#8221; [ Isaiah 63:1], which Rashi explains as damim . One must nullify victory and controversy and pursue shalom , for the Holy One, Blessed be He , found no kli for bracha except shalom [ Ukzin , Chapter 3]. This is achieved by speaking much Torah and tefillah , meriting shalom . In controversy , one makes shalom by raising mayin nukvin . A kushya divides the heart ( lev ), as matters seem contradictory; the terutz makes shalom by resolving them, raising mayin nukvin . [ Ha&#8217;ala&#8217;as mayin nukvin is the arousal of longing ( hishtokekus ) and love ( ahava ) toward another, such as for Hashem or a true tzadik ( righteous one ), connecting to Hashem and His tzadikim . This maker of shalom fosters ahava , uniting and making peace, which is mayin nukvin .] Sometimes, shalom creates peace in another makom , raising mayin nukvin elsewhere. All speeches ( diburim ) of Torah and tefillah are mayin nukvin , as known, &#8220;Creator of the utterance of lips, peace&#8221; [ Isaiah 57:19]. This is the primary rectification ( tikkun ) of briyah , as it is written, &#8220;Maker of peace and Creator of all&#8221; [ Isaiah 45:7]. At briyah , olamot fell through sheviras hakeilim , and osios scattered into nitzotzos . Through mayin nukvin of Torah and tefillah , nitzotzos and osios achieve tzeiruf , forming an olam , which is shalom . Before entering divrei Torah and tefillah , they lack tzeiruf and chibur , existing in shevarim and controversy . Holy dibbur combines them, creating shalom , rectifying and renewing the fallen olamot , as if creating them anew. Thus, our Sages said [ Introduction to Zohar , 5a]: &#8220;And to say to Zion, You are My people&#8221; &#8212;read imi ( with Me ), in My shutafus ; as I create shamayim v&#8217;aretz by My milul , so do you through Torah and tefillah . This is, &#8220;And I will give peace in the land&#8221; [ Leviticus 26:6], raising nitzotzos from artziyus , creating shal

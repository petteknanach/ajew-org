Some said that he made the trip in order to find the writings of the Baal Shem Tov, that he closed off in a stone, and some people say that they are hidden there in Kaminitz, and they said, that he traveled there for this. And he o.b.m. scoffed at this, and he said, that he didn't travel at all for this, because he doesn't need them whatsoever, and he said, if he wanted those writings, they would bring them to his house, however, he has no need for them whatsoever.

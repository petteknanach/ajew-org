FREEDOM - LIBERTY - EMANCIPATION Tuesday, July 22, 2025 Likutay Moharan - Torah-teaching 69 Likutay Moharan, Torah 69 Likutay Moharan, Volume 1, Torah 69 Whoever Steals Wealth from His Fellow, in This He Steals Children from Him כל הגוזל את חברו ממון, בזה הוא גוזל ממנו בנים Whoever steals wealth from his fellow, in this he steals children from him Know that whoever steals mamon (wealth) from his fellow [root: ג-ז-ל ], in this he steals banim (children) from him, meaning the thief takes banim from the robbed. For the main mamon of a person comes through his wife [Zohar Tazria 52a], through the light of her nefesh (soul), from which mamon comes. The sparkling and spreading of lights from her nefesh is the aspect of mamon , for mamon comes from the place of the nefesh , as explained elsewhere [Likutay Moharan 59, 68; Likutay Torah 46]. The nefesh is the aspect of the female, as known in the writings of the Ari [Rabbi Isaac Luria] , the last aspect of vital soul, spirit, and higher soul. The generality of her soul levels is the aspect of nefesh , female relative to the level above it. Thus, through the female, his wife, the aspect of nefesh , mamon comes, as it depends on her, being the aspect of feet, as in the Zohar [Vayeira 112b]: &#8220;And He will guard the feet of His pious ones&#8221; [I Samuel 2:9], this is the woman; &#8220;And all the possessions which are at their feet&#8221; [Deuteronomy 11:6], this is mamon that sustains him on his feet [Pesachim 119a]. For mamon is the aspect of feet, as in &#8220;The wealth of the rich is his strong city&#8221; [Proverbs 18:11]. Our Rabbis said [Bava Metzia 59a]: Honor your wives so that you become rich [Tikkunei Zohar 70, 126a]. Every person comes to the world with his specific wife, an allotted sum of mamon , and fruits, that is, banim , in the aspect of a tree, branches, and fruits. The light of her nefesh is the aspect of the main tree, from which branches come and spread, the sparkling of her light, the aspect of mamon , the branches of the tree. On these branches, fruits, that is, banim , grow. When one steals mamon , he steals the branches of the tree, the sparkling of her nefesh , from which mamon comes. Thus, he steals the nefesh of his banim and daughters, who depend, grow, and draw from the light of this branch, the fruits growing on these branches. Taking the branch takes the fruits. As in &#8220;And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his sons&#8221; [Esther 5:11], for this depends on this. As in &#8220;They have moved, also gained power, their seed is established before them and their offspring before their eyes&#8221; [Job 21:8]; they have moved, gained power is wealth, through which their seed is established. As in &#8220;For all the wealth that G-d saved from our father is ours and our sons&#8221; [Genesis 31:16], ours and our sons specifically, for the main wealth is through the woman, and the banim depend on her, as she is the aspect of the tree, wealth the branches, and banim the fruits. If the robbed has no banim (children) yet, one can steal that he will not have them by stealing the branch. Even if he has banim , it can harm them to die, chas v&#8217;shalom [G-d forbid], if they still need their mother, that is, her branches, like fruits not yet complete, needing to draw from the branch. Thus, taking the branch harms the fruits, the banim , who need to draw from the branch, the sparkling of their mother&#8217;s light. It depends on the theft, the tree, branches, and fruits, as there are many variations among trees, the nature and quality of branches, and their number. Some trees have many branches but few fruits, or few branches but many fruits. Some have one precious branch, others ten worth only ten gold coins. Some poor people have many banim but only one coin, as their branches are inferior, worth one gold. Others have few, inferior branches. A great rich person may have a precious branch or many precious branches, yet few banim . For example, a tree with three branches, each specific to produce two fruits, should yield six banim . If each branch is worth one hundred red coins, it should yield three hundred. If one steals one hundred red coins, he steals one branch, taking two banim . If the fruits emerge one after another, stealing one branch takes two banim , but the remaining banim of other branches remain unharmed. But if they emerge all at once, as in [Exodus Rabbah 1], six in one womb, stealing one hundred red coins, the value of one branch for two fruits, damages the light of all, as they were to emerge together, leaving them without completeness, harming all banim . There are many variations depending on the theft, tree, branches, and fruits. She always needs to complete her light. Without completeness, she cannot give birth. The main completeness is through mamon , the aspect of her sparkling light. As in &#8220;Learn to do good, seek justice, strengthen the robbed&#8221; [Isaiah 1:17], urging to do justice, strengthen the robbed, and save the oppressed from the oppressor to save the nefesh of his banim and daughters. This is learn to do good , for doing justice and saving the robbed from the robber benefits the banim , the aspect of teachings of Hashem , as in &#8220;And all your sons are taught of Hashem &#8221; [Isaiah 54:13]. [Bava Kama 103a]: One who steals from his fellow worth a small coin must pursue him even to מדי [Media]. It is a great wonder why מדי [Media] specifically. The Gemara is hidden and concealed. Their true intention: the thief must pursue him even to מדי [Media], that is, the teachings of Hashem [wordplay: מדי akin to למודי ה' ], the banim he must return, even those stolen by stealing his mamon . This is the aspect of teachings of Hashem . Sometimes, though he takes mamon , he does not harm the banim , and her nefesh is not lacking. In spirituality, the nefesh feels great pain and sorrow when the thief, like a murderer of souls, comes to diminish her light and steal the nefesh of her banim . Thus, she contracts her light, draws, and gathers her soul&#8217;s parts so the thief cannot draw or diminish her nefesh . Sometimes, the thief cannot overpower to receive her nefesh . Though he stole the mamon , the nefesh overpowered, contracted, and gathered her light, not allowing reception. This mamon is not wealth at all, only dust in the world, as it has no light, as in &#8220;Dust of gold&#8221; [Job 28:6], &#8220;Silver is not considered&#8221; [II Chronicles 9:20], as the silver and gold have no light of nefesh . This is the aspect of kiddushin (betrothal, sanctification ceremony). Without completeness, there is a hold of the other side and klipos (spiritual impurities). The nefesh , the female aspect, is among the klipos , scattered and thrust among them, as in &#8220;Her feet go down to death&#8221; [Proverbs 5:5]. Seeing the silver or its worth, the aspect of her light&#8217;s completeness, in the hands of the man who comes to betroth her, she yearns to complete her light and gather her scattered ones from the klipos , to take her feet from death. This is the aspect of kiddushin with silver, as her light is completed, without lack, sanctified from impurity, exiting the klipos , acquired through this silver, the completeness of her light. This is the term kiddushin : she consecrates herself to depart from impurity and receive sanctity through him. In all his dealings and profits, he completes her light and gathers her scattered sparks, always completing her light, the

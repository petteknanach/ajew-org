(-memory of the tzaddik and the holy for a<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>blessing), author of the books Likutay Moharan (two volumes), and the book The<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>Attributes (-Sefer Hamidos – Character), and the Legendary Tales, and additional<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>other compilations which are in manuscript, grandson of the supernal holy etc.<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>Rabbi Nachman of Hurridenker za.tza.l., great grandson of the G-dly Tana<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>(-superlative sage), holy of Israel, our teacher, the rav, Rabbi Israel Baal<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>Shem Tov za.tza.va.ka.l., may their merit protect us and all of Israel,<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>amen.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>In this book will be related a<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>little of his holy life, of his utter toil and exertion in the service of<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>Hashem Yisburach with supremely powerful messeeras nefesh (-self<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>sacrifice), from his childhood days until his passing, until he merited to live<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>true life, life which is truly called life. And it will relate a little of what<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>transpired over him in his holy life, and a little of his holy words which were<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>heard from his holy mouth, and the times that passed over him, as your eyes<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>will see straight out.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>Na<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>Nach Nachma Nachman MeUman</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>“Who will relate the mighty<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>actions of Hashem, make heard all His praise?” (Psalms 106). Who can tell over,<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>who can fathom, all the great, and wondrous, and awesome things done by our<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>master, our teacher, and our rabbi, light of lights, pure, pristine light, the<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>cached, and hidden, and concealed light, with the collective entirety of the<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>souls of Israel, upon whom (/which) are contingent all the worlds. And<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>especially that which he accomplished and did with his men close to him who<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>merited to revel in the holy shade of his shadow, and to hear from his mouth<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>what they heard, matters which Atteek Yoamin (-Ancient of Days – a<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>Supernal Divine Countenance – Daniel 7:9) concealed (Pesachim 119a). And<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>particularly, that which he worked and did with my poor and destitute self,<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>that he erected me from the dust and the dumps, and sat me down next to him,<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>and with his mercy drew me even more, close to him, and placed his hand on me<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>(-approbation, ordination) to receive and to write all his words of Torah, and<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>his discourses, and his legendary tales. All and everything he merited me that<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>it should be written by my hand, and he said explicitly (Chuchma and Beena<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>article 21, and this is a seeming resolution to the query in Yisroel Saba<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>chapter “Above Nature,” that “a little” goes on Rabbi Nussun as well as Rabbi<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>Naftoli) that there is no one that knows from him, except for I (-Rabbi<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>Nussun), a little, and many additional such expressions.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>And in truth, my soul knows<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>very well what is impossible to tell over whatsoever, and I already wrote a<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>lot, and I told over orally to my friends and my students a very great deal,<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>and thank G-d my words made an impact, with his great power, that the truth<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>entered their hearts like burning fire, and they were aroused plentifully to<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>Hashem Yisburach. And many already went on in holiness and purity and passed<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>away with a good name, from the midst of words of Torah, and prayer, and perfect<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>faith, “their portion is in life (Psalms 17:14),” and those who remain for<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>length of days and years, behold they are strong, with the help of Hashem<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>Yisburach, with the truth and the faith, like a molten mirror (Job 37:17), so<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>that they never slip (Proverbs 10:30).</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>Even still, I know in my soul,<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>that they, also they, need very much my information (Shabbos 55b), and they<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>still don't know the light of the truth of the truth to its truth, completely,<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>properly, as it is implanted in my soul. And similar to the homily of our<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>Rabbis o.b.m. (Sanhedrin 68a), a great deal I learned from my rabbis, and I<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>didn't release from them, just, as a dog which laps from the ocean, and my<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>students didn't withdraw from me etc.. What can I say? For all these words of<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>mine involve the knowledge of the pleasant hisnoatzitzus (-sparkling) of<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>G-dliness in the heart, which is for each one according to what his heart<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>fathoms (Zohar, Beraishis 103b), and these themselves are manifestations of his<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>might, these themselves are manifestations of his awesomeness (Yuma 69b), which<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>he exerted and toiled in His service Blessed He so much until he merited to<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>what he merited, and ascended to the place he ascended, (from) which he drew<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>such deep intellect, deep water advice in the heart of a man (Proverbs 20:5),<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>deep, deep who can find it (Ecclesiastes 7:24), to the extent that with his<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>supreme wisdom and his mighty strength he illuminated with his goodness in the<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>heart of (even) the lowest and degenerate hisnoatzitzus (-sparkling) of<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>conception of the Divine, what is absolutely impossible to relate to a friend.<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>And see that this is a novelty which never was ever, and like it is alluded in<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>the torah (-holy teaching) of “A field of knives” (Likutay Moharan 30), see<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>there, that there is a need for a great rabbi, and wondrous craftsman, and<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>loyal doctor, that can impart conception of the Divine in the heart of such<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>small, such sick, such alienated people.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>And behold, if literary means<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>and verbal means are insufficient to tell over a thousandth of what is in my<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>heart, even still it is impossible to release nothing, therefore from the day<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>that I merited to draw close, Hashem Yisburach and he encouraged me to engage<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>in writing the awesome revelation of his holy Torah, and Hashem Yisburach<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>strengthened me to always write the matters and conversation that were by each<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>Torah, because I knew that every single word is a complete Torah. However in<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>the beginning I was not yet careful to write all the holy conversations and<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>holy words that left his holy mouth, just those that had pursuance of words of<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>Torah, or were related to some Torah (-holy teaching).</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>Until after a few years of my<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>drawing close to him, Hashem roused my heart to begin to also inscribe some of<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>the words and matters that were heard from his holy mouth then, and little of<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>what was already heard. Also I inscribed some stories and matters of what<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>transpired to him and his men, and a little of the stories of his exertion and<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>toils which he toiled and exerted in the service of Hashem, through which he merited<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>to what he merited, and the order of his journey to the Land of Israel, and<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>some stories and events that took place by each and every Torah and by each<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>Legendary Tale, and how, and through what his mercy was invoked until he opened<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>his holy mouth and revealed what he revealed.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>And even though with all of<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>these it is impossible to explain and illustrate well in writing the nature of<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>the matter as it was when it took place, even still I did not abstain from<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>writing and inscribing all that is possible to inscribe, and one who has acute<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>intelligence will understand from his own intellect a little of the nature of<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>the matter, all this and perhaps the future generations will merit to know all<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>the fantastic and wondrous feats which were done for us by the Master of All,<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>Who conducts every generation with His kindness, the schemes of His heart<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>(stand) for generation and generation (Psalms 33:11), Who does novelties all<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>the time, so that His name will be proclaimed in all the land, so that they<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>will rouse in every generation to return to Him Blessed He, for He already<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>cleared a correct way before us by his hand o.b.m., so that from now on whoever<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>desires to approach the holy, can easily draw close to Him blessed He, by the<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>ways explained in his holy books. Fortunate is one who adheres to them, “till<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>in them, till in them, age and wear out in them, and do not budge from them,<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>for there is no measure better than them (Ethics of Our Fathers 5:22).”</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>Behold all this my eye saw (Job<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>13:1, 33:29), that it is His will blessed He to inscribe everything in a book,<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>therefore it has been some time now that I took it to my heart to write and<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>inscribe every conversation, and word, and matter, and story that rises in my<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>memory, and these are the very things written in this book. And I called the<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>name of this composition by the name “Life of &lt;Cha'yay&gt; Moa.Ha.Ra.N.<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>[-acronym: &lt;Moarainoo&gt; Our Teacher/Guide &lt;virabbainu&gt;<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>and Leader/Rabbi, Rabbi Nachman], since most of it speaks of his holy life, of<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>what transpired over him in the holy days of his life, and the life which he<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>lived in the world. For he was a truly live man who had no counterpart, and he<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>constantly lived true life, and every time he lived new life, as was heard from<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>his holy mouth, that one time he exclaimed, “I lived today life, such life<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>which I have never lived,” and then he began to reveal a little outline of the<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>torah (Likutay Moharan 18) “Kartulleesuh – A Chest,” as is noted in this<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>book, further on in its place (article 8). And similarly a few times I heard<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>from him o.b.m. wondrous glorification regarding his life, and regarding the<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>degradation of the life of the world who don't consider their tachlis<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>(-ultimate purpose), and also with the life of the world there are innumerable<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>variations, as is explained a little, further on.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>The general principle is, that<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>the essential life is the true life which is true wisdom, as it is written<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>(Ecclesiastes 7), “Wisdom give life to its possessor.” And the main wisdom is<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>to strive and toil to know and recognize Him Blessed He, for He is life of life<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>(chay hachayim). And everyone, according to his proximity to this, so is<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>his life life, and vice versa. And therefore (Brachos 18b) evil people (even)<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>in their lifetime are called (-considered) dead, and vice versa, tzaddikim<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>(even) in their death are called (-considered) alive, for they are always bound<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>in true life, as it is written (Deuteronomy 4), “And you (plural) who are<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>clinging to Hashem your G-d, you are all alive today.” And it is for this life<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>that we pray copiously on Rosh Hashana (-Jewish New Years) and Yom Kippur,<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>“remember us for life,” “and inscribe for life,” because aside from this,<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>everything is vain, and there is no life whatsoever. And regarding this life it<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>says (Deuteronomy 5), “so that you live,” (Deuteronomy 8), “so that your days<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>are plentiful etc.,” (Deuteronomy 5:30), “so that you live.” &#123;censored: However<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>life such as merited by him o.b.m., have still not been experienced by any<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>person in the world&#125;. Fortunate is he who merits to feel a little of the sparkling<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>(hisnoatzitzus) of the pleasantness of his life which he lived, long<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>life, truly good life, as is understood from the story (-Rabbi Nachman's<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>stories, published under the title: Legendary Tales, story 13) of the Seven<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>Beggars, which regarding this life, King David r.i.p. beseeched (Psams 16),<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>“Give me to know the way of life etc..”</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>In this book are written all<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>the stories that we heard from his holy mouth, also some of the conversation<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>and narrative that we heard from his holy mouth, because his words are entirely<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>Torah. Also some incidents that happened and transpired between him and his<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>adherents. And from all of them the intellectual will understand his utter<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>greatness and amplitude of his extremely phenomenal holiness, what the mouth<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>cannot speak nor the heart reckon, and the intellectual at this time will be<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>quiet and silent, and everyone according to what their heart fathoms, will<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>understand an infinitesimal bit, less than a drop of the ocean. And even what<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>we heard and saw, we did not present here, just a tiny bit alludingly. And<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>because of the utter strife that they fought (/multiplied) ardently against<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>him, we are forced to put a restraint to our mouths, so as not to relate his<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>praise. And the utter magnitude of his holiness and loftiness is very loftier<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>and superior than our intellect.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>However, even this minute<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>fragment that we merited to know and understand a little, is impossible to tell<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>over completely because of the great strife, even though it would be beneficial<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>for the world, I just inscribed this for the future generations, and for the<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>coming days which are approaching peacefully, so that it should not be<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>forgotten from our mouths and the mouths of our progeny. In order that the<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>future generations know how greatly cherished (the Nation of) Israel is before<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>Hashem Yisburach, that they merited in the last generations to such lucid and<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>pure light, the light that is cached (ohr haganuz) and hidden. Fortunate<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>is the eye that saw him, fortunate is the ear that heard from his mouth his<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>holy words. And one who studies his holy books in depth will have a slight<br data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>understanding of his utter holiness.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp><em data-astro-cid-pcaemfqp>Content continues in original source...</em></p> </div> </div> </section>

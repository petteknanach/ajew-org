      <p>13. And Rabbainu o.b.m. said, that he got so into the puerility, and got so used to the childish things, so much so that afterwards when he came to the land of Israel and he wanted to discard it, he was forced to force himself with strengths (of his character) to break and to discard the aforementioned childish things, because it was already difficult for him to discard it because of the great regularity - so much he had gotten into the puerility at first. Also afterwards, when he came from the Land of Israel, he was a wondrous novelty in this matter.
And the enormous superlative greatness of his wisdom in this matter (was) - deep, deep, there has not been heard nor has there been seen such as this, because it is known that before one departs from one level to (the next) level, there needs to be a descent before the ascent etc., and then one needs matters of puerility, to be a completely simple person etc.; and he o.b.m., because all his days he did not stand any time on one level, just every time, everyday and every hour, he would ascend always from level to level, therefore his wisdom in these matters was extremely lofty and deep; "deep, deep, who can realize it (Koheles 7:24)."</p>
      <p>14. And then, at that time, it was the war of France (the French Campaign in Egypt and Syria ( 1798–1801) by Napoleon Bonaparte), that France went to the land of the Togar (Ottoman Sultan, as explained previously), to Egypt, and to the land of Israel, and so forth, as is well-known, and when the people of Istanbul heard that the aforementioned war is awakening, and the French are on the way on the sea, thence the holy community of Istanbul did not want to allow any Jew to leave the walls of the city and go out to put out to sea, but Rabbainu o.b.m. did not pay attention to this, and he wanted to act with abandon ("mafkeer") of himself, and he said to the man that was with him: "Know, that I wish to endanger myself even in great and enormous dangers, however, I do not wish to abandon your soul (-life); therefore, if you want, take money for expenses, and return peacefully to your home, and I will travel alone in secrecy and in concealment from the people of Istanbul, because myself I abandon, be what may be etc.." And the aforementioned man refused this, and said, "In the place where my master will be, whether for death or for life, there your servant will be;  and where you go I will go as well."</p>
      <p>And Hashem Yisburach in His mercy "He turns around inductions (Job 37:12, a very reoccurring theme in the books of the Ramchal)," brought about in His mercy, that after a day or two it was heard: Being that there in Istanbul was staying a Great Sage from Jerusalem, who collected by hand donations for the poor of the holy city of Jerusalem, and he had been planning on staying there for another year, and suddenly he was aroused and said to the people of Istanbul: "Know, that it has been revealed to me, that I must travel immediately to Jerusalem, because I see, that the days are impending ("stirring and coming") for the (-my) departure from the world, and you (-plural), do not fear the French nation, and you have nothing to worry about for an Israelite to go there (-to Israel), because certainly there will not occur to them any harm, with the help of Hashem, and Hashem will guard them with His mercy until they arrive there, because the place of my burial is already inscribed to be in Jerusalem." 
And immediately they heeded his words, and they went and chartered a large boat, and they announced: "Whoever wants to go on the boat - should board." And many men, and women, and children went, both from the sphardic people and from the ashkenazic people, and Rabbainu o.b.m. also traveled with them on this boat to the Holy Land, and Rabbainu o.b.m. spoke with the aforementioned sage from Jerusalem that he should take him to Jerusalem, because he said, that he does not want to be, not in Tsfas (-Safed) and not in Tiberius, and so they resolved secretly between them.</p>
      <p>And as they traveled on the sea there was a very great storm wind which is called "a very great afirtineh (-this word was also used earlier in article 9, it is the Turkish word firtina, and can mean a gust, tempest, hurricane, storm etc.)," and the boat was in great danger; "they rise to the heavens, they descend to the depths etc. (Psalms 107:26)," and no one retained in their heart  (conception) that they would be saved from death, and they were all screaming to Hashem; and it was one night like Yom Kippur mamash, with everyone crying, and confessing, and asking for atonement for their souls, and they said slichos ("veniality"- liturgy special for repentance) and other items of prayers and beseechings; but Rabbainu o.b.m. sat silently. And some people started to tell him, why does he remain silent in a time of such a plight, and he did not answer; however, the wife of the Rav of the holy community of Chutin, who was educated, and cried and screamed the whole night, also began to tell him like those, why is he silent - and presumably, he cursed her, and said to her: "If only you (-plural) would also be quiet, it would be good before you; this is the test: if you will be quiet - the sea will be quiet from you as well." And so it was, and they ceased from screaming and they were quiet, then immediately at daybreak - "He stood up the storm making it silent and their waves were quiet/still. And they were happy etc. (Psalms 107:29-)."</p>

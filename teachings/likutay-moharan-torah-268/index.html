- When a Person Does Not Focus on the Purpose, Why Does He Need Life?</b></span></font></font></font></span></p>

a person does not focus on the purpose [</font></font></font><font color="#0000ff"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">ultimate

why does he need life? Behold, the soul always longs to fulfill the
will of its Creator. And when it sees that the person is not doing
His will, blessed be He—G-d forbid—then it longs very much to
return to its root and begins to draw itself to depart from the
person's body. From this, the person becomes ill, because the power
of the soul is weakened as it draws itself away from him, since he
does not fulfill its will—for it wants only that he do the will of
the Place [</font></font></font><font color="#0000ff"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">euphemism

blessed be He. What returns the person to his health through
medicines is because the soul sees that this person can force himself
to act against his desire and habit. For he is accustomed to eating
bread and other foods, and now he forces his desire and accepts
bitter medicines and drugs for his health. Because the soul sees that
he can force his desire for some purpose, therefore it returns to
him, as it expects that he will force his desire for the true
purpose—to do the will of his Creator, blessed be He.</font></font></font></p>

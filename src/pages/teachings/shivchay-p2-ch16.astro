      <p>And immediately after Rosh Hashanah it was the desire of Rabbainu o.b.m. to return immediately to his home, and he did not want to travel at all anywhere, not to Tsfas (-Safed) and not to tiberias, however, the man that was with him, had a very strong yearning to feast his eyes on the places of the Land of Israel, and he came to Rabbainu o.b.m. and said to him, that there is a caravan that they can go with to Tiberius. And he (Rabbainu) answered him: "You have yearning for Tiberius - go charter donkeys." And he did so, and he gave them a down payment ("adruf").</p>
      <p>And upon his return from the owner of the donkeys, he (Rabbainu) said to him immediately: "You chartered donkeys(?)."</p>
      <p>Rabbainu o.b.m. said to him: "Promptly and immediately go and take from them the down payment, and if they do not want to return it to you, then leave the down payment forfeit, because I do not want to go there;" And after 2 or 3 hours the aforementioned man that was with him fell into great weakness, may the Merciful One save us, and then he gave praise and thanks to Hashem Yisburach for preventing him from going with the aforementioned caravan.</p>

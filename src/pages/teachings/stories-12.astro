of
a
Prayer
Leader
A tale.
Once there was a Prayer Leader [/Master of Prayer] who was always involved only
with prayers, songs, and praises to Hashem Yisburach (the Blessed G-d), and he
dwelled outside of civilization. And his program was: he would regularly go
into civilization and enter in [conversation] with some person - typically
going in [conversation] with lowly people, such as poor people and so forth - and
he would start talking with the person regarding the purpose of the whole
world, that truthfully there is no purpose whatsoever in the world except for
serving G-d all one's life, spending the years only with prayer to Hashem
Yisburach, with song and praises to Hashem Yisburach etc.. And he would speak a
lot of such talk with the person to wake him up, until his words entered his
heart, until the person would be willing to join him. And as soon as the person
agreed with him, he would immediately take him and bring him to his place which
he had outside of civilization (i.e. outside of settled places; not where
people dwell), for the Prayer Leader had chosen for himself a place outside of
civilization, and there was a river [Heb.: before it], as well as trees, and
fruits there too, and they would eat of the fruit, and they would not pay
attention to clothes whatsoever - how one goes, he goes.
And so was
the constant schedule of the Prayer Leader, going into civilization and
persuading people to go his way, to only serve Hashem Yisburach and only be
involved with prayers etc.; and who ever listened to him, he would take and
bring to his place outside of civilization, as mentioned, and they would be
involved there, just with prayers, songs, and praises to Hashem Yisburach, and
confessions, fasts, privations (i.e. torturing one's body), repentance, and so
forth; and the Prayer Leader would give them his compositions (i.e. books) that
he had of prayers, songs, praises, and confessions, and they would be engaged in
them constantly, to the extent that there would be found among his people that
he brought there, those who could now also bring people to Hashem Yisburach. He
would sometimes give permission to one of his people, that he could already now
also go into civilization and awaken people to the Almighty, that they should
only serve Hashem Yisburach.
The Prayer
Leader kept doing this, all the time drawing his people and taking them out of
civilization, as mentioned, until an impression was made on the world, and the
thing began to become known, because suddenly people would disappear from the
country and no one knew where they went: this one had a missing son, that one
had a missing son-in-law, and no one knew where they were, until it became
known that there exists a Prayer Leader who goes and talks people into
(serving) Hashem Yisburach. Except, catch him they could not, because the
Prayer Leader would conduct himself very craftily, and would present himself
differently for each person. For this one he presented himself as a poor man,
for that one as a trader, and for another he disguised himself still
differently. Furthermore, when he would come to talk to a person, when he
understood that he could not accomplish with the person what he wanted, he
would speak to him in such circuitous talk that it was not possible at all to
detect that he meant that - that is, to draw him closer to Hashem Yisburach.
And it was impossible to realize that he meant that, even though in truth his
whole intention was only that, for, in the things he chatted and talked about
with people, he meant nothing other than this, that is, to draw them close to
Hashem Yisburach. Only when he understood that he was not influencing him, he
would so deceive and misguide him with talk, until the other thought that he
did not want that at all. (Therefore they could not catch the Prayer Leader.)
The Prayer Leader remained occupied with this matter, until there was an
impression and publicity (all) over the world; and they wanted to catch him but
it was impossible, as mentioned.
So the
Prayer Leader with his people dwelled outside of civilization, and were
involved only with prayer, songs, and praises to Hashem Yisburach, and
confessions, fasts, afflictions, and penances. It was also the Prayer Leader's
business that he could "suffice" for each person (in other words,
provide for each person) what he needed. If he understood of one of his
people that in accordance to his intellect he needed, for serving Hashem, to go
dressed in 'gilden geshtik' (gold [-embossed] clothes), he supplied it for him,
and vice versa, when sometimes some rich person would draw close to him, and he
extracted him from civilization, and he understood that this rich person needed
to go in tatters, he would make him go [dressed] that way; whatever way he knew
a person needed to go, he supplied it for him. And for the people whom he drew
close to Hashem Yisburach, a fast or the biggest privation (i.e. torturing
oneself) was dearer than all the world's delights, for they had more delight
from the big privation or fast, than from all the delights of the world.
And the
day came to pass, and there was a country where there were enormous riches;
they were all rich. Only, their behavior was quite disturbing, because by them,
everything went according to wealth; everyone's status and honor was only
according to his wealth. It was determined by them, that whoever had a certain
amount of money - thousands or ten-thousands - attained one status [Yid.: and
this honor]; and whoever had such and such an amount of money attains another
status; similarly, all the hierarchy by them, was all according to the money
each person had. And he who had so many, so many thousands and ten-thousands,
as was determined there by them - is already a king.
And similarly
they had flags, that whoever had so much money is in this banner, and deserves
status and honor in that flag; and who ever had so much money, is in another
flag, and deserves the status in that pennant, all according to his money. So
it was determined for everyone how much money he should have in order to have
the status in this flag, and how much money he should have in order to already
be in another flag, and have there, some kind of status and honor. And so every
man's honor, and all of his status, was all only according to how much money he
had, as had been determined by them for every status and honor, how much money
he needed to have.
And
similarly it was determined by them, if he has only so much money, he is a
plain human, whereas if he has yet less, he is already no man at all, just a
beast or bird (i.e. it's just a beast that looks like a human). So they had
beasts and birds, that is, if he has this little money, it's just a lion - it's
a human lion; but if he has that little money, he is a mere bird. And similarly
they had other beasts and birds, for someone who has little money, is no man at
all by them, just a beast or a bird. Because the main object for them was
money, and the status and honor of everyone, was only according to his money.
It was
heard in the world that there is such a country. The Prayer Leader made a very
big sigh over this [Heb: would sigh over this, and would say], and he said,
"Who knows how far they can stray through this?" Some men from his
people were present, and they did not ask his opinion at all, and they picked
up and went to that country to get them out of it. Because they (i.e. the
people of the Prayer Leader) had great pity on that country which was so led
astray in the craving of money, and especially since the Prayer Leader had said
that they could go further astray, therefore these people of the Prayer Leader
went to that country; perhaps they could bring them out of their nonsense.
They
entered the country and they approached one of them who was apparently a person
of low-status whom they call a beast, and they began to talk with him, that
truthfully money is not a purpose at all, and the main purpose is only to
service Hashem, and so forth. But he did not listen to them at all, because it
was already rooted in their thinking that the main thing is only money. And
likewise they chatted with another, and he too did not listen. And they wanted
to talk with him more, but he replied, "I have no more time to talk with
you."
They asked
him, "Why?"
He
replied, "Because we all must leave the country and go to another country,
for we have seen that the main goal is only money, therefore it is set by us
that we must go to such a country where they make money (i.e. there, there is a
kind of earth from which they make gold and silver). Therefore we all must go
now to that country."
It was
also settled by them that they wanted to have stars and constellations too,
that is, whoever has so much and so much money, according to the amount they
had determined for it, he should be a star, because since he has so much money
he must have the power of the star, because the star generates the gold,
because the fact that there is earth from which gold is made, is after all, due
to the star that generates such earth from which gold is made. Since this man
has so much gold, he must have the power of this star, therefore he himself is
a star. And likewise they said they wanted to have constellations too. That is,
when someone would have so much and so much money, however much they had
determined for it, he should be a constellation. And likewise they made for
themselves angels, all according to (the amount of) money. Until they agreed
that they should have gods too, that whoever would have vast (amounts of)
money, so many and so many thousands and myriads, however much they had
determined for this, he would be a god, because since G-d gives him so much
money, he himself is a god. [Heb: And so they carried out and did everything
that was mentioned above].
Furthermore
they said that they ought not dwell in the air of this world, and they must not
at all be together with other people, so that they should not contaminate them,
because the other people of the world are completely impure compared to them;
therefore they decided that they should find for themselves very high mountains
that are higher than the whole world, and they should dwell there, so that they
can be higher than the air of the world. They sent people to seek high
mountains, and they found very high mountains. The whole country went and
settled there on the high mountains, that is, on each mountain a gathering of
people from the country (in other words, a city) settled [Yid: and so too on
the other mountains etc.]. And around the mountain they made a big
fortification and great trenches around the mountain, until it was impossible
for any man to reach them, because there was no longer but one hidden path to
the mountain, which no other person had any knowledge of, to reach them. And
likewise on the next mountain, and so on all the mountains, on all of them they
made a fortification etc. as mentioned. And they appointed guards far from the
mountain, so no one [Heb: stranger] would be able to come [Heb: close to them].
So they
dwelled there on the mountains and conducted themselves as mentioned earlier,
and they had many gods, that is, according to the money, as mentioned. However,
since wealth was the main thing for them - so much so that via great wealth a
person could become a god - they were under threat of murder and theft, because
anyone would be a murderer or thief in order to become a god via the money he
would steal. But they said, since the wealthy one is a god, he will protect
himself from theft and murder. And they established devotions and offerings, to
bring offerings and pray to the gods to thereby get money, and they would
sacrifice people, and would sacrifice their very selves to the gods, in order
to be included in them, and later be reincarnated as a rich person. Because
their main credence was in money. And they had devotions, sacrifices, and
incenses with which they served their gods (i.e. those who had much money). But
despite this, the country was certainly full of murder and theft, because
whoever did not believe in the devotions became a murder and thief in order to
get money, because the main thing for them was wealth, since through money one
can buy anything - food and clothing - and the essential life of a man is
through money; therefore money was their main creed (such was their foolish and
confused thinking). And they all tried to not lose any money, because money was
for them the fundamental faith and the god; on the contrary, it was necessary
to endeavor to bring money into the country from other places. Traders would
embark (from them) to trade in other countries, in order to win money, in order
to bring even more money into the country. And charity was certainly a great
prohibition for them, because how can someone be permitted to give away the
money that G-d has given him - which was for them the main thing, to have money
- how can someone be permitted to give that away? Therefore certainly for them
it was a prohibition to give to charity.
And they
had officers who were appointed to monitor everyone whether he has as much
money as he says, because everyone had to always show off his wealth in order
to remain in the status and honor that he had according to his money (in other
words, all the rich people who, for them, were gods, stars, angels etc. due to
their money, would always be inspected whether he has so much money; whether he
is not a god in vain, and so forth, and people were appointed to constantly
oversee this). And sometimes by them, an animal would become a person, or a
person an animal, namely, when a rich person lost his money he already became a
non-human - a man became an animal, because he already had no money for
himself; and vice versa when someone won money, so an animal became human; and
so on with the other classes, which by them were all according to money (it
likewise also happened with someone sometimes becoming a non-god because he had
already lost the money). And they would have the figures and portraits of the
gods (i.e. those who had much money) and everyone had the portraits, and they
would hug and kiss them, because money was their entire devotion and faith.
And the
people of the Prayer Leader (who were previously there in that country)
returned to their place, and they told the Prayer Leader of the nonsense of the
country, how they were so fooled and lost in the craving of money, and that
they already wanted to leave their country for another country (where they make
money as mentioned) and wanted already to make stars and constellations. The
Prayer Leader spoke up and said that he feared lest they stray more and more.
Afterwards people heard that they had already made themselves gods (as mentioned).
The Prayer
Leader spoke up and said, "This is what I meant, this is what I
feared" (i.e. by his always saying he feared lest they get further lost,
he meant this). The Prayer Leader had great pity on them, and came to the
decision to personally go there; perhaps he would extract them from their
foolishness (Heb: return them from their error). The Prayer Leader went there
and came to the guards who stand around each mountain (as mentioned), and the
guards, it would reason, where people of low status who were able to stand in
the air of this world, because the people who had status, from their money,
were not at all able to be together with the people of the world, and could not
stand in the world's air, so that they should not contaminate them, and they
were not at all able to speak with people of the world, so that they should not
contaminate them with their breath (in other words, by the foolish country the
world was completely impure compared to them, as mentioned), therefore the
guards who stood outside the city were surely of low status, except the guards
also had the portraits (of their gods) and would hug and kiss them all the
time, because with them too, money was the main object of faith.
The Prayer
Leader came to one of the guards and began talking with him about the ultimate
purpose, inasmuch as the only ultimate goal is serving G-d - Torah, prayer,
good deeds etc. - and money is utter foolishness and not the ultimate purpose
at all etc.; but the guard did not listen to him at all, for it was already
ingrained in them for a long time that the main thing is only money, as
mentioned. And likewise the Prayer Leader went to all the guards and talked
with them this way, and they did not listen to him whatsoever. The Prayer
Leader came to a decision and went into the city which was on the mountain (as
mentioned).
When he
arrived inside the city, it was the great novelty to them, and they asked,
"How did you get in here?" Since no one was able to reach them.
He
answered them, "Why do you ask? I am already inside the city, all the
same." The Prayer Leader began talking with one of them about the purpose
of the world, that money is no purpose at all etc. (as was his custom), but the
man did not listen to him at all, and likewise another, and likewise all of
them, because they were already so lost in their mistake that they already
could not listen to anybody, as mentioned. And it was a wonder to the people of
the city that such a man exists, and had come to them, and was speaking to them
such things, the complete opposite of their creed. It struck them that this man
must be the Prayer Leader, because they had already heard that there is such a
Prayer Leader in the world, since the matter of the Prayer Leader had already
become publicized in the world (as mentioned), and people in the world would
call him "Der Frummer Baal Tefilah" (the devout Prayer Leader), but
they could not catch him, because he would make himself appear different to
each person: to one he appeared as a merchant, and to another as a pauper etc.,
immediately afterwards disappearing from there (in other words, he was quickly
gone away).
And the
day came to pass: and there was a warrior ('geebor': a muscleman, or a valiant,
mighty, or strong man) unto whom other warriors had gathered. The warrior and
his warriors were going around taking over countries, the warrior wanted
nothing else but submission (in other words, that they should become subjugated
under him). And when the people of the country submitted to him, he would
release them; and if not - he would ruin them. So he went around subjugating
countries, without any desire for money whatsoever - only submission; that they
should be under him. And the way of the warrior was: he would send his warriors
to a country when he was still very far from it - fifty miles - for them to
surrender to him; and so he was continually taking over countries.
And the
merchants of the aforementioned wealthy country, who used to conduct trade in
foreign countries, returned to their country and told over about the warrior,
and a great terror fell on them. And even though they were willing to submit
themselves under him, the thing that prevented them was that they heard that he
loathes money and does not want any money at all, and this was contrary to
their creed, therefore they could not submit themselves under him, because for
them it would be like apostasy, since he did not at all believe in their faith,
that is, in money. And they were very afraid of him, and they began to perform
their devotions, and bring their sacrifices to their gods (i.e. to those who
had much money); and they would take a little beast (i.e. someone with little
money, who was considered by them a beast) and bring him for a sacrifice to
their gods (as mentioned), and similarly they performed the other devotions
(i.e. the things with which they would serve their gods).
And the
warrior was continually coming closer to them, and had started to send his warriors
ahead [to ask]: "What do they want?" - as was his usual custom, as
mentioned. A great terror came over them, and they did not know what to do.
Their own merchants gave them a suggestion, inasmuch as they had been in a
country where the entire populace were gods, and traveled about with angels -
that is, (that country,)  the entire country, from small to great, are all
very extraordinarily wealthy people, such that even the smallest among them is
also a god according to their foolish delusion (because the smallest person in
the country is exceptionally wealthy, and has as much money as was reckoned by
them, that with that much money one becomes a god, as mentioned). And they
'travel with angels' since their horses are covered with such great wealth,
with gold and so forth, that the covering of one horse was worth the amount
that an angel had. Thus, the riders 'travel with angels,' tying three pairs of
'angels' to a carriage, and riding with them.
"Therefore
you need to send to this country and they will surely help you, for they are
all gods." (All this was still the advice of the merchants.) Their advice
pleased them very much, for they believed that they would surely be saved by
the other country, since they are all gods, as mentioned.
And the
Prayer Leader came to the decision that he would go once again to that country;
perhaps he would still lead them out of their folly. And he went there, came up
to the guards, and he began speaking with one guard, in his usual way. The
guard told him about the warrior, that they are in great terror of him.
The prayer
leader asked him, "What do you have in mind to do?"
The guard
told him the idea mentioned above, that they want to send to the country where
they are all gods etc..
The prayer
leader laughed heartily at him and said, "That is quite a great folly!
Because they are humans like we are. And all of you, with all your gods, are
all merely humans, and not one of them is any god at all; there is no more than
one G-d over the world: He who created everything, and He alone should be
served, and only to Him one should pray; and this alone is the main purpose in
the world." This and similar argumentation the Prayer Leader spoke with
the guard, and the guard heard none of it, since their foolish belief had
already been ingrained within them from a long time ago, as mentioned.
However,
the Prayer Leader debated with him extensively, until finally the guard
answered him, "What more can I do? I am only one individual (Heb: in the
world (and against me are the numerous residents of the country))." Now
this already had somewhat of an appearance of a response (/repentance) [Heb:
this answer was a small consolation for the Prayer Leader, because he
understood...], as the words which the Prayer Leader had spoken before with the
guard, and the words which he spoke now, joined together until they stirred him
somewhat. Because the response that the guard had answered, "What can I
do?" etc., revealed that the words of the Prayer Leader were already
starting to enter his heart a little bit.)
And so the
Prayer Leader went to another guard, and also spoke with him in his usual way,
as above; and he too did not listen to him, but in the end he also replied as
above, "I am one person," and so forth, as above. And so, all the
guards answered him this response in the end.
Afterwards
the Prayer Leader entered the city and began to talk with them in his usual
way: inasmuch as they are all very much in complete error, and money is no goal
at all; rather, the essential purpose is solely to delve in Torah, in prayer,
and so forth. They did not listen to him, for they were all very much rooted in
money from a long time ago; and they told him about the warrior, and that they
want to send to the country where they are all gods etc.. He laughed at them
too, and told him that was a folly, and they are all humans etc., "and
they will not be able to help you at all, because you are human and they are
human, and they are no god whatsoever; there is only one God, Blessed is He,
etc." As for the warrior, he replied to them (using this expression),
"Isn't this the warrior?" (like someone wondering: isn't he the one
he knows?) They did not understand what he meant. And so he went from one to
the other, and continued talking this way with them, as above. And as for the
warrior, he said to everyone, "Isn't this the warrior?" etc., as
above. They did not understand his words; what he meant.
Meanwhile,
a commotion broke out in the city, inasmuch as there was found someone who says
such things, making laughter of their faith, and saying that there is only (a
solitary) One, that is, Hashem Yisburach, Blessed is He etc.; and as for the
warrior, he always says, "Isn't this the warrior?" etc. as above.
They understood that this must certainly be the Prayer Leader, because he was
already well known to them, as mentioned. They ordered for him to be sought and
caught. Even though he always appeared differently (i.e. sometimes presenting
himself as a merchant, and sometimes as a poor person, and so forth, wherefore
they were not able to catch him, as mentioned), nonetheless they knew of this
too, that the Prayer Leader constantly presents himself differently; they
ordered an investigation into him, for him to be captured, and he was sought
out until they caught him. And they brought him to the elders.
When they
began talking with him, he told them also as above, "You are all mistaken,
and in great folly, and that is no purpose whatsoever (i.e. money is no goal at
all), but there exists (a solitary) One, Blessed is He, namely the Creator,
blessed be His Name, who has created everything. He alone should be served, and
money is an utter nonsense etc.. And the country where you say they are all
gods - they will not be able to help you whatsoever, for they are only human
etc.."
They
considered him insane, because the entire country was already so immersed in
money, and they were already so crazed, that whoever said something contrary to
their foolishness was for them a madman.
They asked
him, "What is this that you say about the warrior, 'Isn't this the
warrior?'" as above.
He
answered them, "Inasmuch as I used to be with a king, and by the king a
warrior was lost; and if this is that warrior, I am acquainted with him. And
furthermore, your relying on the country where you say they are all gods - this
is nonsense, because they will not be able to help you whatsoever; on the
contrary: that will end up being your downfall if you rely on them."
They asked
him, "Where do you know this from?"
He
answered them, "Since by the king," who he was with, "he had by
him a Hand [yad], that is, the king had something resembling a hand with
five fingers and with all the grooves (i.e. all the creases and ruts) that are
on a hand. And the Hand was the map of all the worlds; and all that has been
since the creation of heaven and earth until the end, and what will be
afterwards, was all depicted on the Hand, for depicted in the scratches and
folds of the Hand, was the diagram of all the worlds; how every world stands,
with all the things of every world in detail, everything standing out on the
Hand as depicted on a land map (as is known to those who are used to land maps,
that is, depicted on a paper is each town, every country, and every bridge; and
similarly other things: streams, woods etc.; and by everything it is all
written down, that this is this town, and this is that country, and so forth).
Thus all the worlds were depicted on the Hand by the ruts and folds of the
Hand. And in the ruts of the Hand were a resemblance of letters, just as
letters are inscribed on a map next to each thing so that one may know what it
is, that is, that one may know that here is this town, and here is this stream,
and likewise other things; in exactly the same way, by the ruts of the Hand
were depicted the likeness of letters next to everything depicted on the Hand,
so as to know what everything depicted there is. Thus every city separately,
every town, and all the rivers, bridges, mountains, and other objects (whatever
is found in the world and in all the worlds) were all depicted on the Hand, by
the ruts and folds on the Hand, and next to everything there always stood
letters, that this is this thing, and that is that things, etc.. And also all
the people who go around in every country, and all their experiences (i.e.
everything that passes over a man during his lifetime), were all depicted on
the Hand.
And even
all the paths from one country to another, and from one place to another, were
written on it, and on account of that I knew the way to come in here, to this
town, which no man can enter (because the wealthy country had dug around their
cities, and nobody could come to them, as above). And likewise if you want to
send me into the other town, I know that way too, all through the Hand. And
also imprinted on the hand, was the way from one world to another world, for
there is a path and a course on which one can ascend from earth to heaven (for,
one cannot go up from earth to heaven, due to not knowing the way; but depicted
there, was the way to go up to heaven); so depicted there, were all the paths
that exist from one world to another world. For, Eliyahu (Elijah) ascended to
heaven with this path, and that path is written there; Moshe Rabbainu (Moses)
went up to heaven with a different path, and that other path was also written
there; and likewise Chanoch (Enoch) ascended to heaven with yet another path,
and that path was written there too. Thus from one world to the other (farther,
higher) world was all depicted by the ruts and folds of the Hand.
Also represented
on the Hand was everything as it was at the time the world was created, and as
it is now, and as it will be in the future. For instance, Sedom (Sodom) was
depicted there as that city had been (while inhabited) before it was
overturned; in addition, depicted there, was Sedom being upheaved, as a city
turning over; and further depicted there, was Sedom as it appears today, after
the upheaval. For on the Hand was depicted what was, what is, and what will be.
And there on the Hand I have seen that the country of which you say they are
all gods, together with all the people who come to them for help (i.e. that the
country should help them), will both (all) be obliterated." (All this for
the Prayer Leader told them).
It was an
extraordinary novelty to them, for it was recognizable that this is true talk,
for it is known that on a map all things are depicted, so they understood that
his words are true, since such things cannot be thought up, because one can see
for himself that he can put together two ruts of the hand and from them will
become a letter. For this reason they understood, this is no contrivance; thus
it was an extraordinary novelty to them. They asked him, "Where is the
king? Perhaps he will show us a way how to find money?"
He
answered them (with an expression of someone who is awestruck and angered),
"You still want money?! Don't talk about money at all!"
They asked
him, "Nonetheless, tell us where the king is."
He
answered them, "I too do not know of the king; where he is. And this is
how the story happened:
"Once,
there was a king and a queen, and they had an only daughter. And it came near
the time to marry her off, so they seated advisors to give counsel as to whom
she ought to be married. And I too was there among the advisors (i.e. the
Prayer Leader, who is still relating this in front of them) because the king
liked me, and my advice was that they should give her the warrior, because the
warrior had wrought us many benefits, for he had conquered many countries;
therefore he ought to be given the queen's daughter for a wife. My advice was
very well received, and they all agreed upon it, and there was a big
celebration there for having found a groom for the queen's daughter. And they
wed the queen's daughter with the warrior, and the queen's daughter had a
child. And the baby was quite an extraordinary beauty, which was no sort of
human beauty whatsoever: his hair was golden and had all the colors, his face
was like the sun, and his eyes were (like) other luminaries. And the child was
born with mature wisdom, because they saw in him immediately, when he was born,
that he is already a great sage, for when people were talking, in the place
when one needs to laugh he would laugh; and so with other such things they
recognized in him that he is a great sage – except he did not yet have the
motions of an adult, that is, he still could not talk and other such faculties
– but this they saw right away: that he is already a big genius.
"And
by the king was orator, that is, a speaker who is a master of language and
rhetoric, who was able to talk very eloquently: very fine expression, songs,
and praises for the king. And the orator was on his own account a fine orator
too, but the king showed him the hidden path and the way for him to go up and
get the power of the science of rhetoric, and thereby he became a very amazing
superb orator. The king also had a sage, and the sage was also a sage on his
own account, but the king showed him the way for him to go up and get wisdom,
and thereby he became an extraordinary, superb sage.
"And
similarly, the warrior was mighty on his own, but the king showed him the way
for him to go and get strength, and thereby he became an extraordinary, superb
warrior. For, there is a sword that hangs in the air, and the sword has three
powers. When the sword is lifted, then all the officers of the [opposing] army
flee, so as a matter of course they fall, because when the officers flee, there
is no one to lead the battle, so they certainly fall. But despite this, the
survivors may still be able to wage war – however, the sword has two sharp
edges, and they have two powers: through one edge, they fall down, and through
the other edge, they get the sickness called 'dahr' (wasting; consumption),
namely they (the enemies whom they are fighting) become meager (-gaunt) and lifeless,
as is known of this sickness; the Merciful One spare us. So by merely making a
move with the sword in its place, the enemies are stricken with the
aforementioned things, that is, by using one edge the enemies have defeat, and
by using the other edge the enemies are stricken with dahr, as
mentioned. And the king showed the warrior the path that there is to the sword,
and from there he attained his great strength.
"And
to me the king also showed the way to get my specialty; I got from there what I
needed. (In other words, the Prayer Leader, who is telling all this, said that
the king showed him the way from which to get his thing, namely, prayer).
"And
likewise, the king had a faithful friend [ohev ne'eman] (in other words,
a good friend, a good, trusty friend) who was in love with the king (lit: who
loved himself with the king) with a very extraordinary love. They loved each
other so much, that it was impossible for them to be one without seeing the
other for some amount of time. But nonetheless there must be times when they
need to be apart, so they had portraits in which both their images were
depicted. They would delight themselves (in other words, take pleasure and
satisfaction with) the portraits when they could not see each other. And the
images depicted how the king and his faithful friend love each other and hug
and kiss each other with great love. And the portraits had the special ability
that whoever looked at the images attained great love (in other words, one
received the trait of love when looking at the images). And the faithful friend
also received the love from the place which the king showed him.
"A
time came when they all went, each one to his place, to receive his power there
for his thing – that is, the orator, and the warrior, and all the king's
people, each went up to his place to renew his power. And the day came to pass
– there was a very big storm wind upon the world. And the storm wind mixed up
the entire world, and overturned sea to dry land, and dry land to sea; and
wilderness to settled area, and settled area to wilderness; so it overturned
the entire world. And the storm wind went into the king's chamber and did
nothing at all there (in other words, there at the king's, it wrought
absolutely no damage), except that the storm wind went in and snatched away the
aforementioned child of the queen's daughter. And amidst the commotion, as soon
as the storm wind snatched away the dear child, the princess followed
immediately (in other words, the princess immediately began to run after the
child in order to snatch him back; she too went off someplace, no one knows
where). So too the queen, and so too the king: they all went after the child,
until they all became dispersed, and no one knows where they are. And all of us
were nowhere nearby during this, for we were gone away then, each to his place
to renew his power, as mentioned; and when we came back, we could no longer
find them all, as mentioned. The Hand too became missing then.
So from
that time on, we have all become scattered, and can no longer go, each to his
place to renew his power, for since the entire world has been overturned, we
now need different paths; therefore we can no longer go up, each to his place
to renew his power. However, the impression that remains by each of us (meaning
the token, that is, the little bit that has remained by each one from long ago)
is also very great – and if this mighty one (which the country feared) is the
king's warrior, he is certainly a very mighty warrior." (All this, the
Prayer Leader told the people).
And they
heard out his words and were very amazed, and now they held the Prayer Leader
fast, and would no longer let him go (because perhaps the warrior who wants to
come upon them, is the king's warrior mentioned above, with whom the Prayer
Leader is acquainted).
And the
aforementioned warrior kept coming closer to the country, always sending
emissaries to them, until he reached the country. And he stationed himself
below the city, and sent his emissaries inside to them (for them to tell him
what they want: to submit themselves or not, as above). They were very
terrified of him, and they begged the Prayer Leader to give them an eitza
(-advice,remedy). The Prayer Leader told them it was necessary to inspect the
conduct of this warrior in order for him to recognize thereby if this is the
aforementioned warrior of the king. The Prayer Leader [went, and he] went out
towards the warrior, and he reached the warrior's army and began talking with
one of the warrior's accompanying warriors (i.e. with one of the sentries) (in
order to examine if he is the warrior whom he is familiar with). The Prayer
Leader asked him, "What do you do? And how did you get together with this
warrior?"
He
answered him (i.e. that one warrior replied to the Prayer Leader), "What
took place was like this:
"It
is written in their chronicles how there had been a great storm wind over the
world, changing sea to dry land, and dry land to sea; and wilderness to settled
area, and settled area to wilderness, mixing up the entire world. And after the
noise and upheaval, the entire world having become so mixed up, the world's
people decided to make a king for themselves. They started to investigate who
ought to be made king over them, and they reasoned, 'Inasmuch as the essential thing
is only the ultimate purpose (tachlis) therefore whoever most occupies himself
with, and exerts himself in the purpose of the world – he deserves to be king.'
They began probing what the purpose is, and several opinions arose among them.
One
faction said that the main object is honor, for, 'We see that the world
considers honor the main thing. Because when a person is not given his respect
– that is, when some word is uttered against his honor – he experiences
bloodshed, because the main thing for the entire world is honor. And even after
death, people are careful to accord the dead his honor, burying him with
respect and so forth (and telling him, 'What is being done for you, is all
being done for your honor'). Even though after death, one no longer wants any
money, and the dead person certainly has no desire for anything, nevertheless
they are particular about the honor of the dead, and guard his honor. Therefore
(it is) honor (that) is the main purpose. They continued saying more such
conjectures and deductions of the sort, that honor is the main object of the
world, until it became settled among them that the ultimate purpose is honor.
Therefore they needed to search for an honorable person (that is to say, a
person who has honor), and moreover the person should also pursue honor, for
since he receives honor and pursues it, and assists (human) nature which
desires honor, therefore this person exerts himself and pursues after the main
goal, and has reached it, because the goal is, after all, honor, as mentioned;
therefore such a person deserves to be king. (All this was the foolish opinion
of a sect of them; and so they found foolish conjectures and deductions until
they became led astray therein, and said that honor is the purpose.)"
Likewise all the other factions that will appear below, all had foolish
reasoning for their foolish notions. (Heb. only: Some of them are explained
below, but Rabbainu of blessed memory, did not want to explain all the
perplexed reasoning for these beliefs, because there are some rationales in
this, that are so perplexing that it is possible to indeed be led astray by
these false rationales; the Merciful One spare us.) "They went searching
for such a person, and they went and saw an old Gypsy beggar being carried, while
following him were perhaps five hundred Gypsies. And the beggar was blind,
hunchback, and mute, and all these people followed him because they were all
his relatives, for he had sisters, brothers, and ragtag (lit. wicked) progeny,
until there came to be so many of them, all of whom followed him and carried
him. And the old beggar was very particular about his honor, for he was a very
angry person and always heaped his great indignation upon them, always ordering
that others should carry him, and always scolding them. Hence this elderly
beggar is a very 'honorable' man, because he is so strict over his honor.
Therefore this beggar pleased them, and they accepted him as (a) king. And
because land also has an effect, for there is a land that engenders and is conducive
(mesugal) to honor, and similarly there is a land that is specially
suited for another trait, therefore this faction (which regarded honor as the
main purpose) sought a country that engenders and is conducive to honor; and
they found such a country that is conducive to it, and they settled there.
"One
faction said that the main object is not honor, and they conceived that the
main object is murder, for, 'We see that all the things that are found upon the
earth – grasses, and all plants and people, and all that is in the whole world
– must all ultimately cease to exist. Hence the very goal of all things is to
be finished off (i.e. destroyed). Therefore, a murderer who kills and destroys
people, is really bringing the world to its purpose.' Therefore they came to
the conclusion that the goal is murder. They looked for a person who would be a
murderer; an angry person and an extremely vengeful person, for such a person
is closest to the purpose (according to their deluded mindset) and he deserves
to be king. They went looking for such a person and they heard a shriek. They
asked, 'What is this, such a screech?!'
"They
replied to them, this shriek is: someone has slaughtered his father and mother.
"They
spoke up, 'Where else can one find such a strong hearted and angry murderer,
that he should murder his own father and mother? This man here (i.e. the one
who killed (his) father and mother) has reached the purpose!' And they were
very pleased with him, and they accepted him as (a) king over them. And they sought
for themselves a country that causes (i.e. brings about) murder, and they chose
a place among mountains where killers abide, and they went there and settled
there with their king.
"A
(Heb: different) faction said that worthy of being king, is he who has a great
abundance of food, and does not eat the fare of other people, but only fine
foods (such as milk, so that his mind should not become coarse); such a person
ought to be king. However, they could not immediately find such a person who
would not eat the foods of other people. In the meantime they chose for
themselves a rich man who had plenty of food (and whose food was a bit finer)
until they would find such a person as they want, who would not eat etc. as
above. And meanwhile, they made the rich man (into a) king until they would
find such a person as they want, as above; then the rich man would descend from
the reign, and the other one would be taken up as (a) king. And they chose for
themselves a country suited for this, and they went and settled there.
"A
(Heb: different) faction said that a beautiful woman is fit to be king, for the
main object is, after all, that the world should be inhabited with people,
since for that reason the world was created. And since a beautiful woman brings
about that desire, through which the habitation of the world grows greater
(since more people come about), it comes out that she brings the world to the
goal. Therefore it is befitting for a beautiful woman to be king. They chose
for themselves a beautiful woman, and she became king over them. And they
sought for themselves a land conducive to this, and they went there, and
settled there.
A (Heb:
different) faction said that the main objective is speech, because the
distinction between a man and a beast is only speech, and since that is the
essential in which a man is greater than a beast, therefore it is the main
purpose (i.e. speech). They sought for themselves a speaker (i.e. a talker) who
would be eloquent, and who would know many languages, and would always talk a
great deal all the time, for such a person is at the goal. They went and found
a French lunatic who was going around and talking to himself. They asked him if
he knows languages, and he knew several languages. Now such a man has certainly
already reached the goal (according to their foolish deluded ideas), since he
is a master of language, knows many languages, and talks a great deal – for he
talks even to himself. Therefore they were very pleased with him, and they
accepted him as (a) king. And they chose for themselves a land conducive to
this, and they went and settled there with their king. And surely he led them
on the straight path!
"A
(Heb: different) faction said that the ultimate purpose is happiness. For, when
a person is born people are happy; when there is a wedding, people are happy;
when conquering a country, people are happy. It follows that the main purpose
of everything is only happiness. Therefore they sought a man who would always
be happy, for he is at the goal, and he should be king over them. They went
searching and they saw a gentile going along with a disgusting shirt and
carrying a bottle of brandy, while following him were several other gentiles.
And this gentile was very happy because he was very drunk. They saw that this
gentile is very happy and has no concern whatsoever, and they were very pleased
with him, this gentile, because he had reached the goal, since the goal is only
happiness. They accepted him as (a) king over them, and surely he led them on
the right path! And they chose a land conducive to this, that is, where there
are vineyards so that they would make wine, and from the seeds of the grapes
they would make brandywine; and nothing whatsoever of the grape vines should go
to waste, because for them this was the main purpose: to drink and go drunk,
and always be happy, despite not having the faintest idea for what, for they
had nothing at all to be happy about. But nevertheless it was the main purpose
for them, to always be happy. And they chose for themselves a land conducive to
this, as above, and they went and settled there.
"A
(Heb: different) faction said that the main thing is wisdom. They sought for
themselves a great sage, and made him (a) king over them, and they sought for
themselves a land conducive to wisdom, and they went and settled there.
"A
(Heb: different) faction said that the main goal is to cultivate oneself with
food and drink, which is called pillevin [Yid. = Ger. pflegen], in order to
enlarge the limbs. And they sought a 'man of limbs,' that is, someone who has
large limbs, and develops himself to enlarge his limbs (i.e. the members of the
body), for since he has big limbs, he has a larger portion in the world,
because he takes up more space in the world; and this man is closer to the
purpose, because the purpose is to enlarge the limbs. Therefore such a person
ought to be (a) king. They went and found a tall man (which is called a
'veynger' [Yid.]) and he pleased them, because he has large limbs and is at the
goal. They accepted him as (a) king, and they sought a land conducive to this,
and they went and settled there.
"And
there was a different group that said that all these things are no goal at all;
rather, the right purpose is to be involved only in prayer to Hashem Yisburach,
and to be a humble person, and a lowly person etc. (in other words, one should
not deem anything of oneself), etc.. And they sought for themselves a prayer
leader, and they made him (a) king over them." (One will already
understand by himself that all the aforementioned factions were all very
mistaken and deluded in great foolishness, each faction in their folly, through
their foolish hypothesis and foolish deductions. Only this last faction hit
upon the proper truth – so fortunate they are!) All this was related by one of
the strongmen before the Prayer Leader. And he went on to tell him, that they
(namely the warriors who were going with the warrior as mentioned) – they are
from the faction of the 'men of limbs' mentioned above (i.e. the faction that
said that the main objective is only to cultivate oneself to enlarge his limbs)
who had taken up as (a) king over themselves a 'man of limbs' (i.e. a large
person, as mentioned).
"And
the day came to pass, and a company of them were going along (in other words,
many of the ample-limbed people were going together) with the wagons in train
(which are called ibez [- Ukr. oboz, train]) bringing along food, drink, and
other such things. Now, the world was certainly afraid of these large-limbed
ones, for they were large and mighty men, and whoever encountered them was sure
to step off the road. Meanwhile, as the camp of the ample-limbed was going
along like that, approaching them from the opposite direction came a big
warrior (and this was the warrior who goes with them now), and this warrior did
not step off the road for them, and he went into the camp and dispersed them
here and there, and the people of the camp were terrified of him. And he (i.e.
the warrior) went inside among the aforementioned wagons which trailed behind them,
and ate up everything that was there. This was an extraordinary novelty to them
(that he is so valiant that he has no fear of them whatsoever, and went right
into their midst, and ate up all that was on the wagons) so they promptly fell
down before him, saying immediately, "(Long) Live the King!"
(meaning, they immediately made him (a) king) because he certainly deserves the
reign. And so it was: they took him up as king (i.e. the warrior who came
against them, as mentioned). "And this is the warrior with whom we now go
about conquering the world. But he says (i.e. the warrior who has now become
king over them) that he means something else in his going about conquering the
world, for he does not at all intend that the world should be under him; rather
he means something else." (All this one of the warriors told the Prayer
Leader who had asked him how they joined the warrior; he answered him all
this).
The Prayer
Leader asked him, "Wherein is the strength of the warrior who is now your
king?"
He
answered him, "Inasmuch as there was a country that did not want to submit
themselves under him, the warrior took his sword which he has, and his sword
has three powers: when it is lifted, all the army officers flee" etc. (and
he recounted the three powers explained above, from which king's warrior got
his strength, as mentioned).
When the
Prayer Leader heard this, he realized that this is certainly the king's warrior
mentioned above. The Prayer Leader asked if it were possible to be granted an
audience with the warrior who is their king. They answered him, it must be
announced for approval ('meldeeven') before him. They went and announced, and
he summoned that he should come in, and the Prayer Leader came in to the
warrior. When he came in to him, they recognized each other, and there was very
great rejoicing amongst them that they merited to be reunited. And there was
rejoicing and crying (happiness and weeping) between them, for they recalled
the king and his men; they cried over that; therefore between them was rejoicing
and crying. The Prayer Leader began to discuss with the warrior how it came
about that they arrived here.
The
warrior told the Prayer Leader that from the time that there was the storm wind
– when they all became dispersed – when he returned from where he went to renew
his power, and did not find the king with all his people, as mentioned, he then
let himself go wherever he would go. And he passed by them all, that is, he
understood he was at the place where the king is, and where all his people are.
That is, he was at a certain place, and he understood that the king is
certainly there, in this place, however he was unable to seek and find him. And
similarly he passed by another place, understanding that the queen is certainly
there, however he was unable to seek and find her; and thus he passed by all
the king's people.
"Only
you I did not pass by!" (i.e. the warrior who is telling this, said to the
Prayer Leader, that he passed by all the places of all the people; only the
place of the Prayer Leader he did not pass by).
The
Prayer Leader replied to him saying, "I passed by all their places, and by
your place as well. For, I was passing by a certain place and I saw the king's
crown standing there, and I understood that the king is certainly here, however
I was unable to seek and find him. And so I went further and passed by a sea of
blood, and I understood that this sea is certainly made from the tears of the
queen who weeps over all this, and the queen is certainly here, however I could
not seek and find her. And so I passed by a sea of milk, and I understood that
the sea is certainly made from the milk of the queen's daughter whose son was
lost, and the milk pressured her, and from this came to be the sea of milk; and
the queen's daughter is certainly here, however I was unable to seek and find
her. And so I went further and saw the golden hairs of the child laid out, and
I did not take from them whatsoever, and I knew that the child is certainly
here, however it was not possible to seek and find him. And so I went further,
passing by an ocean of wine, and I knew that this ocean is certainly made from
the speech of the orator, who stands and speaks consolations before the king
and the queen, and then turns his face and delivers consolations to the queen's
daughter, and from these words came about the ocean of wine (as it is written
[Song 7:10], 'your palate is like good wine'), however I could not find him.
And so I went further, and I saw standing there, a stone which had etchings in
it just like the Hand with its ruts (i.e. just like the Hand with all the
furrows etc. which had been at the king's, as mentioned), and I understood that
the sage (of the king) is certainly here, and the sage had engraved for himself
the depiction of the Hand on the stone, but it was not possible to find him.
And so I went further and I saw arranged on a mountain the golden tables, the
credenzas [display cupboards], and the rest of the king's treasures, and I
understood that the king's treasurer [i.e. he who sits over all the treasures]
is certainly here, however it was impossible to find him." (All this the
Prayer Leader told over to the warrior).
The
warrior replied, "I too passed by all these places, and I did take from
golden hair of the child, for I took seven hairs that had all sorts of colors,
and they are very dear to me. And I settled down and sustained myself with
whatever possible, with grass and so forth, until I had nothing whatsoever to
sustain myself. I let myself roam about, and when I went away from my place, I
forgot my bow there."
The
Prayer Leader replied, "I saw your bow! And I knew that it was certainly
your bow, but I could not find you."
The
warrior went on telling the Prayer Leader that, "When I went away from
that place, I went until I encountered the company mentioned above (i.e. the
rest of the ample-limbed warriors mentioned above), and I entered in their
midst, because I was very hungry and wanted to eat; and as soon as I entered
among them they immediately took me up as (a) king, as mentioned. And now I go
conquering the world, and my intention is: perhaps I will be able to find the
king and his people mentioned above."
The
Prayer Leader began to discuss with the warrior, "What to do with these
people?" That is, with the country that is so fallen into the lust of
money, to the extent that they came up with such crazy foolishness, that those
who have a lot of money are gods for them; and so the other follies the country
had.
The
warrior answered the Prayer Leader that he had heard from the king, that from
all the cravings a person has fallen into, he can be extracted, except for
someone who has fallen in the lust for money; it is impossible to extract him
from it by any means. "Therefore you will have no effect on them
whatsoever, for it impossible to extract them from this at all. Albeit through
the way that there is to the sword mentioned above" – from where he gets
his power as mentioned – "only through this way can one extract from the
lust of money, someone who has sunk into it." (So he heard from the king).
The
warrior remained together with the Prayer Leader for a while, and as for the
country which beseeched the Prayer Leader that he should go out to the warrior
on their behalf, as mentioned, they extended the time: that is, the Prayer
Leader convinced the warrior that he should give them (a) time (i.e. during
which time he should do nothing at all to them). He allotted them time.
Afterwards, they made signs between themselves, that is, the Prayer Leader and
the warrior exchanged signs so that one would be able to know from one another,
(and) then the Prayer Leader went off on his way.
As
the Prayer Leader went on, he saw people going along and entreating Hashem
Yisburach, praying and carrying prayer books. He was afraid of them, and they
were frightened of him too. He stood to pray, and they also stood to pray. Then
he asked them, "Who are you?"
They
answered him, "Inasmuch as when there was the storm wind, the world
separated into many factions, these choosing this thing, and those choosing
that thing (just as all the different factions are explained above). At that
time we chose for ourselves that the main purpose is to be constantly involved
only in prayer to Hashem Yisburach. We sought and found a master of prayer, and
made him (a) king.
When
the Prayer Leader heard this, it exceptionally pleased him, for this is what he
himself wants. He began to converse with them, and showed them the order of his
prayers, and his books, and (his) ideas he had regarding prayers. When they
heard his talk, their eyes opened, and they saw the greatness of the Prayer
Leader; they immediately made him (a) king over them, for their king deferred
the kingship to him, since they saw that he is quite a great man [Heb: that he
is set apart on a very, very high level]. The Prayer Leader taught them how to
pray to Hashem Yisburach, and he made them into very great, complete tzadikim,
for they had been tzadikim before as well, since they had involved themselves
only in prayer, but the Prayer Leader opened their eyes until they became
extremely great tzadikim. The Prayer Leader sent a letter to the warrior, and
informed him how he was privileged and had found such people as he desires, and
had become king over them.
Now
the aforementioned country (i.e. the wealthy land for whom money was the main
objective etc. as mentioned) continued to occupy themselves with their
devotions (i.e. they kept doing wild things and offering sacrifices to their
gods, i.e. to those who had a lot of money, as mentioned), and the additional
time that the warrior had given them was already shortly transpiring. They were
very frightened, and they did their devotions, and offered sacrifices and
incense, and engaged in their prayers which they prayed to their gods. They
caught a little critter, that is, such a person who has little money, and
offered him as a sacrifice to their gods. And they were convinced that they
must act upon their first plan which they had been given, that they should send
to the country where they are all gods there, because they have very
extraordinary wealth there (which according to their opinion makes them all
gods) and that country would certainly save them, since they are all gods, as
mentioned. They did so, and they sent emissaries there to that country.
Meanwhile
on the way, as the emissaries were going, they got lost, and they discerned a
man walking with a cane, his cane was worth more than all their gods, that is,
his cane was set with very expensive diamonds, so that the cane was worth more
than the riches of their gods. Should one put together all the riches of their
gods, and even of the gods of that country they're going to, the cane would be
worth more than all their riches. Furthermore, the man was walking with a hat
in which there were diamonds, so that the hat was also worth a fortune. As soon
as the emissaries noticed this man, they immediately fell down before him,
bowing and prostrating (that is, they bowed profusely before him), because
according to their foolish opinion, this man is a god over all gods, for he has
such extraordinary, great wealth. (And this man whom they encountered was the
king's treasurer mentioned above).
The
man said to them, "This here is a novelty to you!? Come with me, I will
show you wealth!" He led them atop the mountain where the king's treasury
was arranged, and he showed them the treasury. As soon as they saw the
treasury, they immediately fell down, bowing and prostrating, because he is a
god over all gods (according to their foolish and deluded opinion, because by
them the essential faith was money as mentioned). Albeit they brought no
sacrifices, for in accordance with their belief that he is such a god etc. they
certainly would have offered themselves to him, however (when the emissaries
departed) the emissaries were warned not to offer any sacrifices on the way,
for they were afraid that should they want to offer sacrifices along the way,
none of them would remain, for maybe one of them will find a treasure on the
road; maybe one of them will enter there (Heb: which would be a god for him).
He will want to sacrifice himself to it, and none of them would be left;
therefore the country warned the emissaries that they should not offer any
sacrifices on the way, whatsoever. [Heb: Therefore these emissaries did not
offer sacrifices to this aforementioned warden. But this was clear to them:
that he was a god over all gods, since he possessed such astounding and vast
wealth].
The
emissaries came to the decision: What reason remained for them to go to those
other gods, that is, to the country they were sent to, where they are all
extremely rich (people), whom they considered to be gods? Much better that this
man – he can help them better, because he is a god over all of them (according
to their crazed notion), since he has such extraordinary, great wealth, more
than everyone (many, many times over)? Therefore they beseeched this man that
he should go with them (in) to their country. He was content to oblige them,
and went with them, and entered their country. There was a great celebration in
the country, that they had acquired such a god, for they were already sure now
that through him they would have a deliverance, for he is such a god, since he
has such a great fortune. The man (who was the king's treasurer, as mentioned,
who was accepted by the countrymen as god) ordered that until there would be a
proper order in the country, no one, in the meantime, should offer any
sacrifices. (For this treasurer was in fact a great tzadik, for he was of the
king's people, who were all very great tzadikim. The treasurer certainly
loathed the foolish practices of the country, but he was incapable of leading
them out of their evil way; however, for the time being, he ordered them that
in any case no sacrifices should be brought).
The
countrymen started to beseech him regarding the aforementioned warrior of whom
they were very terrified, and the warden also replied to them, "Could this
be the warrior (whom he knows)?"
The
treasurer got up and went out to the warrior, and asked the warrior's people if
it were possible to be granted an audience with him, and they said that they
would announce it.
They
announced it. He ordered [for] him [to be] let in, and the treasurer entered
before the warrior. They recognized each other, and there was celebration and
crying between them, as above (i.e. they were very happy that they were
privileged to find each other, but still wept very much: how can the rest of
the aforementioned people be brought as well?).
The
warrior spoke up to the treasurer, "Our kosher Prayer Leader is also here,
and I have already seen him, and he has already become a king!" (Heb.
only: And they told each other how it evolved that they arrived here).
The
treasurer told the warrior that he had passed by everyone, that is, by the place
of the king with all the people as mentioned above; only by the two of them he
did not pass, that is, by the place of the Prayer Leader and the warrior he did
not pass. The treasurer talked with the warrior about the country that had
become so errant and so deluded in money that they had fallen into such
nonsense.
The
warrior answered the treasurer that which he had told the Prayer Leader, that
he had heard from the king that whoever has fallen into the lust of money
cannot be taken out of it by any means, except by that way (Heb: of the sword,
from where the warrior receives his power and might) as mentioned.
Again
they extended the time, that is, the treasurer convinced the warrior that he
should give the country yet another date. The warrior gave them another date.
Then
they made signs between themselves – the treasurer and the warrior – and the
treasurer left the warrior and returned to that country. (Now, the treasurer
certainly kept rebuking them severely over their evil way in which they had become
so abased in (the desire of) money, but he could not lead them out of it, since
they were already very deeply rooted in it. But nonetheless, since the Prayer
Leader and the treasurer had talked with them very much, they had already
become a little confused, and kept saying, "On the contrary! Take us out
of it!" Even though they still held themselves fast in their foolish
notion, and did not want [to get] out of their nonsense at all, nevertheless
when they were rebuked, they kept saying, "On the contrary, if it is
indeed so that we are mistaken, please take us out of our error!")
The
treasurer replied to them, "I will give you a suggestion (against the
warrior). I know the warrior's power and from where he gets his strength."
And he told them the matter of the sword, mentioned above, from where the
warrior gets his strength. "Therefore I will go with you to the place of
the sword, and by this you will be able to stand up against the warrior (for
you will also get strength from there)." And the treasurer's intention
was: when they arrive at the sword's place, they will already be (Heb. only:
able thereby to return and get) out from their money craving (for by means of
that way to sword, thereby a person gets out of the desire for money, as
mentioned).
The
country accepted his advice, and sent their magnates, who were gods for them,
and they went together with the treasurer to sword. (And the gods, that is, the
magnates who went with the treasurer, certainly went dressed in gold and silver
jewelry, since this was the main thing for them). So they went together, the
treasurer and the country's magnates whom they called gods.
The
treasurer informed the warrior of this thing, inasmuch as he is going with them
to seek the place of the sword, and his intention is, maybe he will be
privileged to find on the way, the king and his people.
The
warrior replied, "I too will go with you." The warrior disguised
himself (so that the people going with the treasurer would not know that he
himself is the treasurer) and also went the treasurer.
They
(the treasurer and the warrior) decided, they would inform the Prayer Leader of
this as well. They informed him, and the Prayer Leader replied, he will also go
with them. The Prayer Leader went to them, and before he went away, the Prayer
Leader ordered his people that they should pray for this, that Hashem Yisburach
should make their venture successful; that they should merit to find the king
and his people, for the Prayer Leader used to always pray for this, that the
king and his people should be found, and always used to order his people that
they should pray for this, and now that he wanted to go with the treasurer and
the warrior, so that they should go together to search for the king and his
people, he urged them even more to pray for it constantly, that they should
merit to find them. The Prayer Leader came to the treasurer and the warrior,
and there was certainly great rejoicing amongst them – celebration and weeping,
as before. They, all three, went together, that is, the treasurer, the warrior,
and the Prayer Leader, with the 'gods', that is, the country's magnates (who
were called 'gods' in their country) going with them.
They
went and went, and they came to a certain country, and there were guards there
standing around the country. They asked the sentries, "What sort of
country is this, and who is your king?"
The
guards replied: Inasmuch as when there was the storm wind, at which time the
world became separated into numerous factions (i.e. into many opinions, as each
sect had a different opinion, as mentioned), then the people of the country
chose for themselves that the main thing is wisdom, and they took up for
themselves a great sage as (a) king. Not long ago they found quite an
exceptionally great wise man, who is an extraordinarily very great wise man.
The king relinquished the kingship to him, and they took him up as king, since
for them the main thing was wisdom.
The
three of them (i.e. the treasurer, the warrior, and the Prayer Leader) said
that it appears that this must be our sage (i.e. the king's sage). They asked
if it were possible to be granted an audience with him, and they answered them,
"It must be announced." They went and announced, and he ordered them
to come in. They (i.e. the three of them) entered into the sage, who had become
king in the country. They recognized each other, for this sage was indeed the
king's sage mentioned earlier. There was certainly great celebration there –
rejoicing and weeping, for they wept, "How to merit to further find the
king and the others?"
They
asked the sage if he knows anything about the king's Hand. He answered them
that the Hand is with him, but since the time that they had become dispersed by
the storm wind – from that time onward, he does not want to look at the Hand at
all, because the Hand belongs exclusively to the king. Only, he had carved out
a depiction of the Hand on a stone, in order to use it a little for his own
concern; but upon the Hand itself he doesn't look at all.
They
discussed with the sage how he had came here, and he told them that since the
time the storm wind happened, he went where he would go (and as he went, he
passed by everyone [Heb: of the king's people]; only by the three of them, that
is, by the place of the Prayer Leader, the warrior, and the treasurer he did
not pass by), until the country found him and took him up as (a) king; and now
in the meantime he must guide them according to their way, according to their
paralogisms, until later he will lead them out to the proper truth.
They
talked with the sage regarding that country that had become so deluded about
money etc., and they said, "If we had been cast about and dispersed for
nothing more than on account of that country, in order that we should correct
them and turn them to the truth, it would also be worth it, for they have
become so deluded." Because in truth, all the aforementioned factions,
each one had chosen its nonsense; this one wanting honor, and this one, murder
etc. – they had all become deluded and needed to be led out to the correct
purpose, because even the sect that had chosen for itself that the main thing
is wisdom, they too had not reached the true purpose, and needed to be led out
from that, for they were under the persuasion of foreign wisdoms and heresy; however,
it is easier to extract people from all the follies, but these ones are so
deluded in the idolism of money, and are so fallen into it, that it is
impossible to extract them from it.
And
the sage also replied to them, that he too had heard from the king that it is
possible to extract someone who has fallen into any craving, but from the
craving of money it is impossible to extract, other than by the way that there
is to the sword, as mentioned. The sage said, he too would go with them, and
all four of them, went along, and the 'gods' (i.e. the wealthy ones of the
country) went with them too.
They
came to a certain country, and they also asked the watchmen, "What sort of
country is this, and who is your king?"
They
answered them: Inasmuch as there had been the storm wind, the people of this
country chose for themselves then, that the main purpose is speech. They took
up an eloquent talker as (a) king. Later they found an extremely superb bard
and orator; they accepted him as (a) king, because the king relinquished the
kingdom to him because he is so eloquent.
They
realized, "This surely must be our king's orator." They also asked if
it were possible to be granted an audience with the king.
They
answered them, "We must announce it." They announced it, and he
ordered that they should come in.
They
entered to the king, and it was the king's orator. They recognized each other,
and there was also great rejoicing and weeping between them.
The
orator also went with them, and they went further in search; maybe they would
find the rest of them, for they saw that Hashem Yisburach was helping them; (so
that) they repeatedly find their friends. And they attributed all this to the
merit of their kosher Prayer Leader who is always praying for this, and through
his prayers they were privileged to always find their friends. They went
onward; maybe they will additionally find the others.
They
went and came to a certain country, and they also asked, "What sort of
country is this, and who is your king?"
They
answered them, that they are of the faction that had chosen for itself that the
main goal is to go drunk and be happy. They had taken up for themselves some
drunkard as (a) king, because he is always happy, but later they found a man
sitting in an ocean of wine, and they were very much more pleased with him,
because this is certainly a very big drunkard, for he is seated in a sea of
wine. They took him up as (a) king.
They
also asked for an audience with him, and they [the guards] went and announced
it. They went in to the king, and this was the king's faithful friend who had
been sitting in the sea of wine that had come about from the talk of the orator
who consoles them, as mentioned. (And the countrymen figured that he is a great
drunk since he sits in a sea of wine, so they took him up as (a) king.) When
they went in to him, they recognized each other, and there was great rejoicing
and weeping between them, as before. And the faithful friend went with them as
well.
They
went onward and came to a certain country. They asked the watchmen, "Who
is your king?"
They
answered that their king is a beautiful woman, insofar as she leads to the
goal, because the goal is habitation of the world (i.e. that the world should
be inhabited with people, as mentioned). And initially they had a beautiful
woman as a queen; then they found a beauty who is a very exceptional beauty,
and they accepted her as (a) queen.
They
realized, this must surely be the queen's daughter. They also asked for an
audience with her, and they went and announced, and they entered in to the
queen and recognized that this is the queen's daughter herself. And the
rejoicing that was there is certainly unimaginable. They asked, "How have
you come here?"
She
told them that after the storm wind happened and had snatched away the dear
(boy-) child out of the crib as mentioned, immediately in that frantic moment,
she ran after the child but did not find him. The milk pressured her, and from
this the sea of milk came about. Then the country found her and accepted her as
king over them. And there was a great celebration there.
But
they also wept abundantly over the dear (boy-) child who is not there, and over
her father and mother whom she [the queen's daughter] doesn't know of (their
wellbeing). But now already the country has a king too, because the husband of
the queen's daughter, who had become queen here, is already here – for the
warrior himself is her husband – so now the country had a king.
The
queen's daughter asked the Prayer Leader, for the time being, to go in her
country and purify them a little, (meanwhile,) of their repulsive vice, because
since for them the main purpose was a beautiful woman, they were certainly very
defiled and deep in their lust, therefore she asked the Prayer Leader to
meanwhile go purify them of it, in the meantime (i.e. he should tell them mussar so that they should not be so deep in this craving of
promiscuity), so that they should not be so crude in this vice, because beyond
it being a craving, moreover it was like a faith for them, that this is the
goal (because all of the factions that had each chosen its bad thing as the
purpose, as mentioned – for each of them the objective was just as a creed,
that this is the purpose), therefore she asked the Prayer Leader to go and
purify them a little, in the meantime.
Afterwards,
they all went searching for the others. They went and came to a certain
country, and also asked, "Who is your king?"
They
answered them that their king is a one year old, for they are from the faction
that had chosen for themselves that whoever has an abundance of food, and is
not nourished from what other people eat – he should be made (a) king. They
temporarily accepted a wealthy man as king. Then they found a man who was
sitting in a sea of milk, and they were exceptionally pleased with him, because
this man was nourished his whole life from milk, and was not nourished from
what other people eat, therefore they took him up as (a) king. And for that
reason he is called a "one-year-old," since he lives on milk like a
one year old. They realized that this is surely their child. They requested an
audience with him, and they went and announced. They entered in to him and they
recognized each other, for he also recognized them, even though he was only a
little child when he was snatched away – nevertheless, because he was a mature
sage since his birth, since he was born with great wisdom as mentioned,
therefore he recognized them, and they of course recognized him. There was
certainly a very great celebration there, albeit they still wept that that they
did not know of the king and the queen. And they asked him, "How did you
get here?"
He
told them that when the storm wind had snatched him away, it carried him away
where it carried him, and he was there in that place, and sustained himself
with what he found there, until he came to the sea of milk. He understood that
this sea was certainly made from his mother's milk, for the milk certainly
pressured her, and that is how the sea came about. He settled there on the sea of
milk, and was nourished by the milk until these countrymen came and took him up
as (a) king.
Then
they went onward and came to a country. And they asked, "Who is your
king?"
And
they replied that they had chosen for themselves that murder is the goal. They
accepted a certain murderer as king, then they found a woman sitting in a sea
of blood, so they took her up as king, because they saw that she is surely a
very great murderer since she is seated in an ocean of blood. They also asked
for an audience with her, and they went and announced. They entered in to her,
and this was the aforementioned queen who keeps crying constantly, and her
tears come to be the sea of blood mentioned. They recognized each other, and
there was certainly a very great celebration there, albeit they still wept that
they still did not know of the king.
They
went onward and came to a certain country. They asked, "Who is your
king?"
They
replied that they had chosen for themselves as a king, a certain honorable
person (i.e. a person who has honor, as mentioned), because for them the main
purpose is honor. Then they found sitting in a field, an old man wearing a
crown on his head. They were very pleased with him, for he is a dignitary, for
he sits in a field adorned with a crown, and they accepted him as king. They
realized that this is certainly their king himself, and they also asked if it
was possible to have an audience with him. They went and announced, and they
entered in to him and recognized that he is the king himself. And the rejoicing
that was there, is certainly inconceivable (in the mind). And the foolish
'gods' (i.e. the very wealthy ones from the land of riches who went with them)
were traveling with them, and for the life of themselves, they knew absolutely
nothing about what was happening, why there is so much happiness here.
And
now the entire holy community [kibbutz] was recovered, and had gathered
united together, that is, the king and the holy people. They sent the Prayer
Leader to all the countries (i.e. the countries of all the factions that had
each chosen for itself a bad thing as a goal, as mentioned) to correct them and
purify them; to lead them out of their error, each country out of its vice and
its nonsense, for they had all become deluded, as mentioned, and now the Prayer
Leader certainly had the power to go to them, and turn them around to the right
way, for he had received power and permission from the kings of all the lands,
since here were all their kings, as mentioned (because the king and his people who
had come together – they all were the kings of all the lands of the factions
mentioned above). The Prayer Leader went with their power to purify them, and
bring them back in teshuva (repentance).
The
warrior spoke with the king regarding the country that is so fallen into the
idolism of money. The warrior said to the king, "I heard from you that
through the way that I have to the Sword – through it, it is possible to
extract someone who has fallen into the idolism of money."
The
king answered him, "Yes, it is so." The king told the warrior (the
thing, how one can take them out of the craving of money through that way):
"Inasmuch as on the way where he goes to the Sword there is a way on the
side; by this way one comes to a fiery mountain, and on this mountain crouches
a lion. And the lion, when he needs to eat, goes and falls upon the flocks, and
takes for himself sheep and cattle, and eats them up. And the shepherds know of
this, and guard the sheep intensely from him, yet the lion does not pay any attention
to this – just whenever he wants to eat, he falls on the flocks, and the
shepherds bang, and strike, and storm at him, the lion however, does not hear
this at all, he just takes sheep and cattle for himself, and roars, and eats
them. And the mountain of fire is entirely invisible (in other words, there is
a mountain of fire there, only, one does not see it).
"And
moreover, from the side there is yet another way; with this way one comes to a
place called 'Kech' (Kitchen). And there in that kitchen there are all
sorts of food, and in the kitchen there is no fire whatsoever; rather, the
foods are cooked by way of the fiery mountain mentioned above. And the fiery
mountain is very far from there, but channels and pipes go from the fiery
mountain to the kitchen, and thereby all the foods are cooked. And the kitchen
too is not at all visible, but there is a sign (-indication): there are birds
standing there on the kitchen, and through them one knows that the kitchen is
there. And the birds hover with their wings, and they thereby kindle the fire,
that is, by the birds' flapping, they blow on, and inflame the fire, and also
by their very flapping, they put out the fire, so that the fire should not
flame too strongly, more than necessary; and they blow on the fire according to
what is necessary for the foods, that is, for one food, such a fire is needed,
and for another food, a different fire is needed – all according to the food,
so the birds blow on the fire." (The king told all this to the warrior).
"Therefore
lead them (i.e. these people from the land of riches who are 'gods', there)
first against the wind, so that the smell of the foods should get to them. Then
when you give them from the foods, they will surely cast away already, the
craving for money." The warrior did so, and took these people, that is,
the magnates from the land of riches who are gods in their country, who came
here with the treasurer, as mentioned. Now, when they left their country with
the treasurer, the countrymen gave them power that whatever they do shall be
done, and the whole country must abide by whatever they do.
The
warrior took the people and led them on the way (which the king told him, as
mentioned), and he brought them up until the kitchen where the foods are. And
first he led them against the wind, and the smell of the foods wafted over to
them, and they began to beg him intensely to give them from those good foods.
Then he led them (away) from the wind, and they began to scream, "It
stinks terribly!" He again brought them against the wind, and again the
good smell of the foods reached them, and again they begged intensely that he
should give them from the foods, then he led them again (away) from the wind,
and they again began to scream, "It stinks outrageously!"
The
warrior responded to them, "Don't you see that there is nothing whatsoever
here that stinks. It must certainly be that you yourselves stink, for here,
there is nothing that has a bad odor."
Then
he gave them from the foods. As soon as they ate of these foods, they
immediately began to cast away (from themselves) their money, and each one dug
for himself a grave and buried himself in the pit due to the great disgrace
that they were so ashamed of themselves, because they felt that money stinks
intensely (Heb. only: which smells like actual feces) because they had tasted
of the foods. And they scratched their faces, and buried themselves, and could
not lift their faces at all, and each one was ashamed in front of the other
(because such is the special power [segulah] of the foods, that whoever
eats of the foods is very repulsed by money) because there in that place money
is the greatest disgrace of all disgraces, and when someone wants to say
something derogatory about another, he spits out at him, "You have money!"
for money there, is a huge embarrassment, and the more money someone has, the
more he is ashamed, therefore they buried themselves out of great disgrace, and
each of them was unable to lift his face even in front of the other; even more
so, in front of the warrior. And whoever still found by him any gilden (-dinar)
or grush (-penny), would rid himself of it immediately, and throw it away (from
himself).
Then
the warrior came to them and took them out of their pits that they had dug for
themselves there out of disgrace, and he said to them, "Come with me,
because now you need no longer have any fear of the warrior, for I myself am
the warrior!"
They
begged the warrior to give them from the foods (in order) to bring into their
country, because they themselves would surely despise money already, however,
they wanted that the whole country should get out of this lust of money. The
warrior gave them from these foods, and they brought the foods into their
country, and as soon as they gave them from these foods, they all immediately
began to cast away their money, and buried themselves in the earth out of
shame; and the very wealthy and the gods were most ashamed, but even the lesser
people who were called 'animals' and 'birds' by them, were also ashamed for having
been so little in their own eyes until now because they had no money, because
now they knew that on the contrary, it's just the opposite: money is the main
disgrace. For these foods have such an effect (segula), that whoever
eats from these foods, very much detests money, for he feels the stench of
money exactly like feces. They all cast away their money, and their gold and
silver. Then they sent them the Prayer Leader, and he gave them teshuvos
(- ways to make amends and return to HY) and tikkunim (- rectifications),
and he cleansed them. And the king became king over the entire world, and the
entire world returned to G-d, Blessed is He, and they were involved only in
Torah, prayer, teshuvah, and good deeds. Amen, may it so be His Will,
Blessed is Hashem for eternity, amen and amen.
[Notes
Following the Story]
The
verse states that Hashem Yisburach has an oven in one place, and fire in a
different place, distant from the oven, as written [Isa. 31:9], "Says
Hashem, Whose fire is in Zion and His oven in Jerusalem;" see there the
entire chapter, which speaks of this whole story. "Woe to those who
descend to Egypt for assistance, and rely on horses … (verse 3) However Egypt
is man and not G-d, and their horses, flesh and not spirit" – alluding to
the country, the land of riches, that they relied upon to save them, for
according to their mistaken beliefs they considered them all gods, and their
horses angels, as explained above in the story; see there. This is why the
verse concludes, "and (-however) Egypt is man and not G-d, and their
horses are flesh and not spirit etc." understand this.
"And
Hashem will stretch out (/turn) His hand, and the helper and the helped will
stumble and fall; and together they will all perish." This alludes to the
Hand, for on the Hand they saw that both would perish together, the helper and
the helped, as mentioned.
"Like
the growling of the lion and the young lion over his prey, which a band of
shepherds is called forth against it etc. (verse 4), Like flying birds (verse
5)"- this alludes to the lion and the birds mentioned. Take a good look
above inside the story and understand. "For on that day each man will
detest his silver idols and gold idols etc.. (verse 7)"
"And
Assyria shall fall by the sword not of man… and shall flee from the sword
(verse 8)… and his rock shall become weak from fear (verse 9)," this
alludes to the three powers of the sword in the story. 'And he will fall,' 'and
he will flee' allude to two of the powers, 'and his rock will become weak from
fear,' alludes to the illness of dahr, where one's strength and power wither
and disappear, for 'his rock' refers to their strength; this alludes to the
third power of the sword. Take a good look and understand.
Then
the verse (9) concludes, "says Hashem, Whose fire is in Zion and an oven
He has (/for it) in Jerusalem," these are the oven and fire in the story.
Look,
and see, and understand how this chapter explains the entire story. (All the
above were the Rebbe's words.) And Rabbainu of blessed memory said this explicitly,
that the entire story from beginning to end is alluded to in its entirety in
this chapter [i.e. Isa. 31], and he said that all the ideas of the story, all
of them can be found in the Scriptures and so forth.
[e.g.
"You shall render impure the plating of your silver graven idols and the
adornments of your golden molten idols, disperse and estrange them like a
menstruating woman, proclaim on it expulsion (Isa. 30:22)." And similarly
the verse, "On that day [the] man will throw away his silver gods and his
gold gods etc. to the deep ditches etc. to come into the crevices of the rocks
etc. (Isa. 2:20-21)," that is they will throw away the desire for money
which is actual idolatry, and they will hide themselves in ditches etc., as is
explained in the story, because money stinks like actual excrement, as it is
written, "You will disperse and estrange them as a menstruating woman,
proclaiming on it expulsion ['tzay' – go out, is the same root as 'tzoah'
excrement]." And so forth one can find all phenomena of the story in the
Scriptures and so forth.]
But
the integral story in its entirety was said on the aforementioned chapter, for
there it is all explained and alluded to entirely. However, we do not know how,
beyond what the Rebbe revealed to us explicitly (i.e. what is explained above).
But the rest of the story's events we did not merit to perceive how they are
hinted in that chapter, however, he stated explicitly that the entire story is
alluded to there.
The
order of the king and his men is as follows: The Prayer Leader and the warrior;
the treasurer and the sage; the orator and the faithful friend; the queen's
daughter and her child; the king and the queen (t.n. the queen and the king).
That is their order, and they correspond to 'the World of Rectification'. And
they are ten concepts, but they are not reckoned in order, that is, these ten
are not reckoned according to the order explained in books of kabbalah. But
there are hidden factors. It is also explained in the books, that when the
influx of one attribute passes through another attribute, when the influx
tarries there, then it is named after that attribute. That is, the (hosting)
attribute in which tarrying in it is the influx of another attribute which is
passing through it, is called by the name of the attribute from which that
influx is coming. And because of this the order here is different. There are
also other elements involved, which are elucidated to those proficiently adept
in the books. The Rebbe of blessed memory said all this explicitly. I also
understood from his words, that the death and rectification of the kings [t.n.
enumerated at the end of Parshas VaYishlach, referring to the destruction and
reconstruction of the worlds which took place before the aforementioned 'World
of Rectification'] are alluded to in this story, although neither the aspect of
the destruction, nor the aspect of the rectification are mentioned in the order
of the ten aspects mentioned above, for the reasons and factors mentioned
above.
But
the matters are still hidden and sealed, because the secret of the story he did
not reveal at all; he only enlightened our eyes with the verses and ideas
above, so that we should know that there are very great and awesome hidden
secrets in the story. But we do not know the extent. Fortunate is one who
merits to understand a bit of the secrets of these stories explained in this
book, because they are all extremely wondrous and awesome novelties,
"Deep, deep, who can find it out? [Eccl. 7:24]," "What shall we
say... what shall we speak [Gen. 44:16]," "Who has heard such a
thing? Who has seen such a thing? [Isa. 66:8]."

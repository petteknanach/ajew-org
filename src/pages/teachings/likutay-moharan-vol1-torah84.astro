FREEDOM - LIBERTY - EMANCIPATION Tuesday, July 22, 2025 Likutay Moharan - Torah-teaching 84 84 In what did you prolong your days? He said to him: I was yielding in my money. [In the language of the ḥaverim (friends)] &#8212; It is stated in the Gemara ( Megillah 28a ): &#8220; In what did you prolong your days? He said to him: I was yielding in my money. &#8221; To explain this, one must understand that which is written in the holy Zohar ( Parashat Naso, 123a ), and this is its language: Come and see: For the six days of creation, each one has its partzuf [spiritual configuration] of that level that governs it. And you will not find a single day that does not contain good, etc. And every day has its boundary from the outside, so that no person may enter into that good&#8212;such as darkness that covers the light, etc. And therefore, one who is guilty and enters to understand the secrets of the Torah &#8212; how many snakes and scorpions [i.e. destructive spiritual forces] confuse his mind so that he will not enter into a place that is not his. But one who is good &#8212; all those guardians say to him: &#8220;The accuser becomes a defender,&#8221; and they elevate him to that hidden good, and they say: &#8220;Our Master, behold, a good and righteous man and one who fears Heaven seeks to enter before You,&#8221; etc. That hidden good says to them: &#8220;Open for him through this gate that is called &#8216;love&#8217;, or through this gate that is &#8216;teshuvah&#8217; [repentance].&#8221; Every righteous individual enters according to his level. And there is no good except Torah ( Avodah Zarah 19b ). And when a person desires to contemplate and think upon the Torah &#8212; meaning, upon the secrets of Torah &#8212; those guardians, snakes, and scorpions confuse his thoughts. These are the distracting thoughts that come to a person. But when a person truly desires and yearns very much, they open for him, as mentioned above in the holy Zohar . Then each and every day is exceedingly great for him &#8212; because he sees and grasps the hidden good, that is, the secrets of Torah that belong to that day. And this is what the Tanna asked: &#8220;In what did you prolong your days?&#8221; That is &#8212; through which middah [spiritual attribute] from among the attributes did you enter the hidden good, and thereby your days were extended and made great, as explained above? And he answered him: &#8220;I was yielding in my money.&#8221; This is the middah of Avraham Avinu (Abraham our father), and it is the gate called &#8220;ahavah&#8221; [love], and it is the right side. And it is brought in Tikkunei Zohar ( Tikkun 70, p. 118a ): From the right side &#8212; a white brain like silver, meaning that all the accusers and all the snakes and scorpions &#8212; which are the foreign thoughts that confuse his mind &#8212; become whitened like silver. And therefore it is said regarding Avraham ( Genesis 24:1 ): &#8220;And Avraham was old, advanced in days&#8221; &#8212; meaning that all his days were complete and great. For from the right side &#8212; a white brain like silver &#8212; and from the accuser, there became a defender. And he was able to enter each and every day into the hidden good that was designated for him. Posted by NaaNaach at 9:07&#8239;PM Email This BlogThis!

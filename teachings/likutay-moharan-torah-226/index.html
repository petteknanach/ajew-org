the wicked mostly they sing melodies of wailing and sadness because
they are aspects of the soul of the mixed multitude and the mother of
the mixed multitude is Lilith that she wails always and therefore
they make melodies of wailing as above and what that the way of
people to draw to these melodies because their suckling from aspects
of &quot;And the eyes of Leah were tender&quot; [Genesis 29] from
aspects of damage of sight, aspects of curse lacking as it is written
(there 1) &quot;Let there be lights&quot; lacking this is Lilith
(Tikkunei Zohar Tikkun 44 folio 79:) and the main melody is from
aspects of the tribe of Levi that they were conductors in song, that
they are from the sons of Leah and then when Levi was born it is said
&quot;This time my husband will be joined to me&quot; because by that
Levi was born that he is the side of melody (Zohar Shemos folio 19)
by this aspects of drawing, that will be joined and drawn to her and
therefore music that is extended and descends from there, from
aspects of &quot;And the eyes of Leah were tender&quot; has strength
to draw, aspects of &quot;this time will be joined&quot; as above and
when they sing these melodies above on Shabbos by this they raise
them because on Shabbos the light is completed aspects of what our
Rabbis, their memory for blessing, said (Berachos 43:): A large step
takes the light of his eyes etc. and returns it to him at Kiddush of
the sunset it is found that on Shabbos the light in completeness
aspects of: &quot;They step in it a small step&quot; and then raises
the melodies that their suckling from damage of the sight as above by
Shabbos that it is aspects of repair of the sight in completeness as
above.</font></font></font></p>

needs to include left in right, as above and even though so needs to
precede the fear (see Tikkunim introduction) because owner of lost
seeks after his lost [as our Rabbis, their memory for blessing, said
(Kiddushin 2b). Way of a man to seek after a woman parable to a man,
that lost to him a lost etc. interpretation: because love it aspect
of man and fear she aspect of woman as known and therefore needs to
precede the fear because then the love comes to him automatically
because love goes and seeks after the fear always because owner of
lost seeks after his lost as above so I heard from his holy mouth
explicitly] and this is aspect of: and if throws rider arrow etc. and

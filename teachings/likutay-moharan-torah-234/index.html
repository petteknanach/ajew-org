that stories of deeds from tzadikim that is from what happened to
them it is a very great thing and by this his thought is purified but
it is impossible to tell stories of tzadikim except who can resemble
himself to Hashem, blessed be He, that is who can distinguish between
light and darkness like Hashem, blessed be He, as if because
corresponding to every deed of a tzadik there is corresponding to it
evil that is that there is corresponding to it deeds of wicked, that
also to them happened like this for example that we find that Pinchas
did a great thing that flew in the air and corresponding to this
there is a deed of wicked, that also Bilam flew in the air and
similarly the like because the evil opposite the good and the
difference is only who can distinguish between light and darkness
this knows the greatness of the difference and the distinction
between deeds of tzadikim to deeds of wicked because this from the
side of holiness by his prayer as it is written in Elisha &quot;Tell
me now the great things&quot; [2 Kings 8] that is that he did the
miracles by prayer (Megillah 27) but deeds of wicked they are by
stratagems or sorcery or another thing from the other side it is
found that the main difference knows only this who knows to
distinguish between light to darkness that is between evil to good
and also who does not have this knowledge to distinguish etc. but he
has complete faith that he believes the difference that there is
between them as above also this can tell stories of tzadikim but one
needs that the faith be complete faith very clarified until that by
the faith it will be similar to him as if he sees the thing that he
believes with the eyes literally aspects of closed and open as
brought in another place [above in sign 62] and this that is brought
in the Midrash (Bereishis Parsha 2): &quot;To distinguish between the
light and between the darkness&quot; light these are deeds of
tzadikim darkness these are deeds of wicked that is that deeds of
tzadikim they are aspects of light and to the opposite deeds of
wicked they are aspects of darkness and who can distinguish between
light to darkness can tell stories of tzadikim as above and by this
his thought is purified also, he is saved from troubles because
confusion of the knowledge it is aspects of small brains and from
this come troubles because small brains they are aspects of judgments
and stories of deeds of tzadikim they are aspects of great brains as
it is written: &quot;Tell me now the great things&quot; aspects of
the great light and by this purifies his thought from evil thoughts
that they are drawn from small brains and by this sweetens the
troubles and the judgments that all of them are from aspects of small
brains as above. Also one needs to know how to tell the deed because
in every deed there is contraction and also when he wants to purify
his thought by telling the deed of the tzadik it is found that is
made with him from the deed and from the telling that it is speech is
made with him thought and certainly one needs that this tzadik that
he tells from him be higher than him in order that deeds of that
tzadik, be aspects of thought with him therefore one needs to know
from whom to tell and how to tell and then his thought is purified
and he can ascend to the world of thought that this is called ascent
of the worlds because the thought is very high and who wants to enter
to the world of thought, needs to be silent and even if he speaks
then proper speech it damages the thought because the thought is a
very high thing that even proper speech damages it and this is
aspects of (Menachos 29): Be silent thus it arose in thought that to
ascend to the thought one needs to be silent and even if he is silent
and does not speak at all nevertheless there are confusions that
confuse the thought and prevent it and for this one needs purity of
the thought and this by stories of deeds as above and to merit to
this, that he can resemble to Him, blessed be He, to distinguish
between light and darkness as above it is by providence that is that
he goes out from naturalness that this is aspects of generality of
the holiness and this they merit by the Land of Israel because the
Land of Israel it is generality of the holiness that in all the
holies because there all the ten holies and therefore it is said in
the Land of Israel, &quot;Always the eyes of G-d your G-d are on it&quot;
[Deuteronomy 11] because there it is only providence, aspects of
&quot;Look down from Your holy abode&quot; [Deuteronomy 26] and this
(Psalms 16) &quot;I have set G-d before me always&quot; that is when
I want to equate and to resemble myself to Hashem, blessed be He as
above then &quot;before me always&quot; that is aspects of the Land
of Israel as it is said in the Midrash (Psalms 105). There is no
always except the Land of Israel as it is said: &quot;Always the eyes
of G-d your G-d are on it&quot; and know that there is a name that
when they want to make a king they use this name and the name is
Kamah (see Vayakhel Moshe Parsha 141) initial letters look down from
Your holy abode and this is aspects of &quot;Who removes kings and
sets up kings&quot; [Daniel 2] and this that is said in Joseph &quot;And
behold my sheaf arose&quot; [Genesis 37].</font></font></font></p>

        Whoever desires to merit teshuvah [repentance] should be accustomed to reciting Tehillim [Psalms], for reciting Tehillim is a segula [propitious means] for teshuvah. For there are fifty gates of teshuvah, and forty-nine gates every person can enter and attain. But the fiftieth gate is the aspect of the teshuvah of Hashem [the Name, G-d] Himself, as it were, for we find even with Him, blessed be He, an aspect of teshuvah, as it is written: "Return to Me, and I will return to you" (Malachi 3:7).
      </p>

      <div class="hebrew-quote">
        כָּל הָרוֹצֶה לְזַכּוֹת בִּתְשׁוּבָה
      </div>

      <p>
        These forty-nine gates of teshuvah are the aspect of the forty-nine letters that are in the names of the twelve tribes of Yah. For each gate has a letter from the forty-nine letters of the tribes. Behold, all desire to fear Your Name, yet not every person merits to perform teshuvah. For there is one who has no arousal at all for teshuvah. Even one who has arousal for teshuvah does not merit to reach the letter and gate of teshuvah that pertains to him. Even if he reaches there, it is possible that the gate of teshuvah is closed. Due to all this, a person does not merit teshuvah.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through reciting Tehillim, even one who has no arousal at all for teshuvah is aroused to perform teshuvah. Also, through Tehillim, he merits to reach the gate and letter that pertains to him and to open the gate. Thus, he merits through Tehillim to perform teshuvah. This is the aspect of: "The utterance of the man raised on high, pleasant songs of Israel" (2 Samuel 23:1). Our Sages, of blessed memory, expounded (Moed Katan 16b): He established the yoke of teshuvah. Through the aspect of pleasant songs of Israel, meaning the book of Tehillim that he established, the yoke of teshuvah was raised, for through Tehillim, one merits teshuvah, as mentioned above.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is what our Sages, of blessed memory, said (Avodah Zarah 4b): David was not worthy of that deed, except to teach teshuvah to the individual, and so forth. Thus, the essence of the teaching of teshuvah is through David HaMelech [King David]. The essence of the teshuvah of David HaMelech is the book of Tehillim, which he said with great arousal and with the holy spirit, such that each and every person, according to his level, can find himself within the book of Tehillim and merit teshuvah through reciting Tehillim, as mentioned above.

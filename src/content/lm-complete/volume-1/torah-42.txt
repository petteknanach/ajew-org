FREEDOM - LIBERTY - EMANCIPATION Wednesday, August 27, 2025 Likutay Moharan - Torah-teaching 42 Likutay Moharan Volume 1: Torah 42 Likutay Moharan Volume 1: Torah 42 &#8220;And He saw their distress when He heard their rinah (cry [musical prayer])&#8221; [Psalms 106:44] [In the language of our master, Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, of blessed memory] 1. Music and Sweetening Judgments Through neginah (music [spiritual melody]), the dinim (judgments [divine strictures]) are sweetened, as it is written in the holy Zohar [Pinchas 215a]: The keshes (bow [rainbow, symbolizing Divine Presence]) is the Shechinah (Divine Presence [G-d&#8217;s immanent aspect]). And the three gvanim (colors [divine attributes]) of the keshes (bow) are the avos (Patriarchs [Abraham, Isaac, Jacob]), and they are garments of the Shechinah (Divine Presence). And when it [ Shechinah (Divine Presence)] is clothed in garments of lights, then: &#8220;And I will see it to remember the bris olam (everlasting bris [covenant of spiritual unity])&#8221; [Genesis 9:16]. Then &#8220;and the wrath of the king subsided&#8221; [ chamas hamelech shachachah (the king&#8217;s anger subsided)]. [Like a parable of a king who was angry at his son, and when the king sees the queen in garments of lights, he has mercy on his son.] And the letters of the tefillah (prayer [liturgical devotion]) are the Shechinah (Divine Presence), as it is written: &#8220; Adonai (Lord [divine name]), open my lips&#8221; [Psalms 51:17], for dibbur (speech [expression]) is associated with the Name Adonai (Lord). And tefillah (prayer) is called a keshes (bow), as Rashi explained [Genesis 48:22] on the verse: &#8220;With my sword and with my keshes (bow)&#8221; [Genesis 48:22], meaning the language of tefillah (prayer). And the kol haneginah (voice of the music [melodic expression]) are the three gvanim (colors) of the keshes (bow), for in the kol (voice [sound]) there is aish (fire [divine passion]), mayim (water [divine mercy]), ru&#8217;ach (wind [divine spirit]), which are the three avos (Patriarchs). The avos (Patriarchs) are the three gvanim (colors) of lights, in which it is written: &#8220;And I will see it to remember&#8221; etc. It emerges that one who plays [ menagein (articulates [melodically expresses])] the letters of the tefillah (prayer), and the kol haneginah (voice of the music), when they are performed in zechus (merit [righteous intent]) and with great beirus (brightness [spiritual clarity]), then he clothes the Shechinah (Divine Presence), which is the letters, in garments of lights. And the Holy One, blessed be He, sees it, then &#8220;and the chamas hamelech (wrath of the king) subsided.&#8221; And this is what Rashi explained regarding: &#8220;When He heard their rinah (cry)&#8221; , meaning in the zechus ha&#8217;avos (merit of the Patriarchs [ancestral merit]). [When the neginah (music), which are the three gvanim (colors) of the keshes (bow) as mentioned above, is in beirus (brightness) and great zechus (merit)&#8212;for the three gvanim (colors) are the avos (Patriarchs), as mentioned above, and they are garments of the Shechinah (Divine Presence)&#8212;and when these garments are lights, in zechus (merit) and beirus (brightness), it is called the zechus ha&#8217;avos (merit of the Patriarchs).] Then: &#8220;And I will see it to remember the bris olam (everlasting bris )&#8221; . Then: &#8220;And He relented according to the abundance of His chasadim (kindnesses)&#8221; [Psalms 106:45], that is, &#8220;and the chamas hamelech (wrath of the king) subsided,&#8221; and the dinim (judgments) are sweetened. 2. Faith in Sages and Shofar Blowings Also, through emunas chachamim (faith in sages [trust in their wisdom]), that he believes that all their diburim (speeches [teachings]) and their ma&#8217;asim (deeds [actions]) are not simple, and there are razim (secrets [mystical insights]) in them, through this he clothes the keshes (bow) in garments of lights. Then: &#8220;And I will see it to remember the bris olam (everlasting bris )&#8221; , for the tzadik (righteous person) is the aspect of a keshes (bow), as Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai said to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi [Ketubos 77b]: &#8220;Was a keshes (bow) seen in your days?&#8221; And it is brought in the holy Zohar [Pinchas 215a]: &#8220;One whose uvdoy (deeds [spiritual actions]) are to illuminate in them the Matronisa (Matronita [Aramaic for Shechinah, Divine Presence]) and to strip from her garments of darkness that she had stripped, and to adorn her in garments of gvanim nehirin (colors of lights [secrets of Torah])&#8212;what is written about it? &#8216;And I will see it to remember the bris olam (everlasting bris ),&#8217; for &#8216;light&#8217; is called a raz (secret [mystical insight]). And at that time rugza (anger [divine wrath]) rises from him, and the chamas hamelech (wrath of the king) subsided.&#8221; Also, one who makes a fine garment for the tzadik (righteous person), through this the dinim (judgments) are sweetened. Also, this refers to aspects of teki&#8217;os (blowings [of the shofar]). For teki&#8217;ah (blast [single note]), shevarim (broken notes [three notes]), teru&#8217;ah (tremolo [nine short notes]) are the avos (Patriarchs)&#8212;Avraham, Yitzchak, Yaakov. And your sign for this is keshes (bow), that is teki&#8217;ah (blast) etc. [Zohar Pinchas 230a]. And this is what is written: &#8220;And the Shaddai (Almighty [divine name]) shall be in your distress&#8221; [Job 22:27], for the Name Shaddai (Almighty) represents the avos (Patriarchs) [Zohar Pinchas 231a]. For ש&#1473; ( shin [first letter of Shaddai, symbolizing three branches]) represents three branches of the tree, which are the avos (Patriarchs). And they are the three Names of the yichud (unity [divine oneness]): Hashem Elokeinu Hashem (Hashem, our G-d, Hashem), which are 14 letters. And they are the 14 of Shaddai (Almighty). Avraham, Yitzchak, Yaakov, they are the initials of Hashem Elokeinu Hashem (Hashem, our G-d, Hashem) [ י&#1456;ה&#1465;ו&#1464;ה א&#1457;ל&#1465;ה&#1461;ינו&#1468; י&#1456;ה&#1465;ו&#1464;ה ]. &#8220;There is no saying and there are no devarim (words), without their kol (voice) being heard&#8221; [Psalms 19:4]. This is the aspect of keshes (bow) and kol (voice), the three gvanim (colors) of the keshes (rainbow). Posted by NaaNaach at 4:19&#8239;AM Email This BlogThis!

FREEDOM - LIBERTY - EMANCIPATION Thursday, August 28, 2025 Likutay Moharan - Torah-teaching 31 Likutay Moharan, Torah 31 Likutay Moharan, Torah 31 [In the words of our Rebbe, of blessed memory] They said to him, &#8220;We have a ב&#1468;&#1461;יר&#1464;א [ bayra &#8211; well] in the wilderness [ ד&#1468;&#1463;ב&#1456;ר&#1464;א &#8211; dabra ]. Bring it into the city [ מ&#1464;ת&#1464;א &#8211; masa ].&#8221; He brought פ&#1468;&#1464;אר&#1461;י [ parai &#8211; bran], threw it to them, and said to them, &#8220;Plait for me ropes [ ח&#1463;ב&#1456;ל&#1461;י &#8211; chavlai ] of bran, and I will bring it in.&#8221; They said to him, &#8220;And is there anyone who plaits ropes from bran?&#8221; He said to them, &#8220;And is there anyone who brings a well from the wilderness to the city?&#8221; [Rashi: פ&#1468;&#1464;אר&#1461;י &#8211; parai is bran. Make for me a rope from bran. And if you do not fulfill my request, I too will not fulfill your request.] 1. Tzedakah [ charity, righteousness ] is an aspect of the galgalim [ wheels, celestial spheres ], as our Sages, of blessed memory, said: &#8220;For because of this thing [ ב&#1468;&#1460;ג&#1456;ל&#1463;ל &#8211; biglal ] the L-rd your G-d will bless you&#8221; [Deuteronomy 15:10] . ג&#1468;&#1463;ל&#1456;ג&#1468;&#1463;ל [ galgal ] is that which revolves in the world (-the rich become poor and the poor become rich) [Shabbos 151b] . And because of this, it [ tzedakah ] contains six blessings and eleven blessings, as our Sages, of blessed memory, said: &#8220;One who gives a penny (prootah) to a poor person is blessed with six blessings, and one who appeases him with words is blessed with eleven blessings&#8221; [Bava Basra 9b] , corresponding to the seven planetary stars and the twelve constellations. For tzedakah directs all the galgalim of the heavens, in the aspect of: &#8220;The way of the eagle [ נ&#1462;ש&#1473;&#1462;ר &#8211; nesher ] in the heavens&#8221; [Proverbs 30:19] . נ&#1462;ש&#1473;&#1462;ר [ nesher &#8211; eagle] is rachamim [ compassion ], which is tzedakah [Zohar, Yitro 80b; Bava Basra 10a; Zohar, Naso 148b] . And this is what Shmuel said: &#8220;The paths [ ש&#1473;&#1456;ב&#1460;יל&#1460;ין &#8211; shvilin ] of the heavens are as clear to me as the paths of Neharday&#8217;a&#8221; [Berachot 58b] , meaning the paths of the light of knowledge [ nehorai day&#8217;ah ], in the aspect of tzedakah , rachamim . And the primary [ ikar ] compassion is through da&#8217;as [ knowledge ] [see below, Torah 56, 105, 119] . 2. And regarding what is lacking from the blessings&#8212;since there should be seven blessings and twelve blessings, yet according to the Gemara, for the one who gives and the one who appeases, there are only seventeen blessings&#8212;know that the primary perfection of the galgalim , the perfection of tzedakah , is only through Shabbos. As it is stated: &#8220;The sun on Shabbos is tzedakah for the poor&#8221; [Ta&#8217;anis 8b] . This means that tzedakah does not have the perfection of light except through Shabbos. Through Shabbos, it shines like the sun, in the aspect of: &#8220;A sun of tzedakah &#8221; [Malachi 3:20] . And this is why the Tanna juxtaposes [ מ&#1463;ס&#1456;מ&#1460;יך&#1456; &#8211; masmich ] in the Mishnah: &#8220;The carryings out of Shabbos are two, which are four&#8221; , and juxtaposes to it: &#8220;The poor person extended [ פ&#1468;&#1464;ש&#1473;&#1463;ט &#8211; pashat ] his hand&#8221; [Shabbos 2a] . For the primary radiance of the light of tzedakah and its perfection is only on Shabbos, because the primary importance of tzedakah is emunah [ faith ], in the aspect of: &#8220;And he believed in Hashem&#8221; [Genesis 15:6] . And Shabbos is emunah , for one believes in the renewal of the world and His unity. And emunah is the source of blessings, in the aspect of: &#8220;A man of faith [ א&#1457;מו&#1468;נו&#1465;ת &#8211; emunot ] has many blessings&#8221; [Proverbs 28:20] , and in the aspect of: &#8220;And G-d blessed the seventh day&#8221; [Genesis 2:3] . And there is no perfection to the blessings until they are received from the source of blessings. For this reason, it is written of them six blessings and eleven [to indicate their lack of perfection]. And this is what our Sages, of blessed memory, said: David came and established them on eleven, Isaiah came and established them on six, Habakkuk came and established them on emunah [Makkos 24a] , to teach that there is no perfection to da&#8217;as [ knowledge ], which is the Torah, and no perfection to the galgalim , except through emunah . Also, what we find regarding the galgalim , that their primary movement is from west to east, yet the daily galgal forces them from east to west&#8212;this matter we find regarding tzedakah . East [ מ&#1460;ז&#1456;ר&#1464;ח &#8211; mizrach ] is the aspect of the one who gives tzedakah , in the aspect of: &#8220;From the east [ מ&#1468;&#1460;ז&#1456;ר&#1464;ח &#8211; mizrach ] I will bring your seed&#8221; [Isaiah 43:5] , in the aspect of: &#8220;Sow for yourselves for tzedakah &#8221; [Hosea 10:12] . And west [ מ&#1463;ע&#1458;ר&#1464;ב &#8211; ma&#8217;arav ] is the one who gathers the tzedakah , that is, the poor person, in the aspect of: &#8220;And from the west [ מ&#1460;מ&#1468;&#1463;ע&#1458;ר&#1464;ב &#8211; mima&#8217;arav ] I will gather you&#8221; . And this is: &#8220;More than the householder does for the poor, the poor does for the householder&#8221; [Midrash Ruth, Parasha 4] . For the primary movement from west to east means the primary action is what the poor does for the householder. 3. And know that there is no existence of emunah except through the aspect of bris [ sexual purity ], in the aspect of: &#8220;And My bris is faithful to him&#8221; [Psalms 89:29] . And this is why it is said that the bris is on Shabbos, as it is written: &#8220;An eternal bris between Me and the children of Israel&#8221; [Exodus 31:16] , and: &#8220;If not for My bris day and night, I would not have established the laws of heaven and earth&#8221; [Jeremiah 33:25] . For the &#8220;laws of heaven and earth&#8221; are the galgalim , which depend on the bris . 4. And know that the afflictions a person experiences on the roads are due to the galgalim of the heavens. For there is nothing below that does not have a star above. There are stars that cause certain types of grasses to grow in the places where they shine, and there are those that require there be a path for people in the places where they shine, and there are those that require there be a wilderness, and there are those that require there be a settlement in the places where they shine. And according to the radiance of the stars on a place, so the place is conducted. And this is the aspect of: &#8220;The ways of Zion mourn because none come to the appointed time [ מו&#1465;ע&#1461;ד &#8211; mo&#8217;ed ]&#8221; [Lamentations 1:4] . Mo&#8217;ed is the aspect of the galgalim of the heavens, through which time is reckoned. And this is: &#8220;The way of the wicked is like darkness&#8221; [Proverbs 4:19] , for the stars and constellations do not shine for them, and through this they stumble. And everything depends on the bris , in the aspect of: &#8220;If not for My bris &#8230;&#8221; . And this is why all roads are presumed to be dangerous [Yerushalmi Berachot 4:4; Midrash Rabbah, Ecclesiastes] , in the aspect of: &#8220;Have I endangered myself?&#8221; [Numbers 22:30; see Sanhedrin 105b] [where it refers to an act of licentiousness]. This means that the r</p>

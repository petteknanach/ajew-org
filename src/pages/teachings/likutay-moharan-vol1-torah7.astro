FREEDOM - LIBERTY - EMANCIPATION Sunday, July 20, 2025 Likutay Moharan - Torah-teaching 7 Likutay Moharan 7 VeEleh HaMishpatim [In the language of our Rebbe, his memory for blessing] And these the judgments that you place before them (Exodus 21:1) Our sages, their memory for blessing, said: Woman was equated to man (Kiddushin 35a Bava Kama 15a) And it is in Mekhilta: Perhaps the students learn and do not understand Talmud says: "That you place before them" Arrange them before them like table arranged 1. Know, that main the exile is only because of lack of emunah (faith) as it is written "Come, gaze from head of Amana" (Song of Songs 4:8) (see Tanchuma parashat Beshalach [10]) And emunah (faith) he aspect of tefillah (prayer) as it is written "And his hands faith" (Exodus 17:12), and its targum: spread in prayer And this aspect of miracles above nature because tefillah (prayer) above nature because the nature obligates so and the tefillah (prayer) changes the nature and this matter of miracle and for this needs emunah (faith) that he believe that there is Renewer and in His hand to renew thing as His will and main emunah (faith) aspect of tefillah (prayer) aspect of miracles is only in land of Israel as it is written "Dwell land and pasture faith" (Psalms 37:3) And there main ascents of the prayers as it is written "And this gate of heaven" (Genesis 28:17) (there 15) And for this when Avraham blemished in what shall I know and by this blemished in inheritance of land that she aspect of emunah (faith) , aspect of tefillah (prayer) was exile of Egypt and specifically Jacob and his sons descended Egypt because they aspect of twelve versions of the tefillah (prayer) and lowered them in exile And Egypt he opposite the miracles as it is written "And Egypt flee to meet it" (Exodus 14:25) that there no place of the miracles and there no place of the tefillah (prayer) as it is written (there 9): "And it will be when I go out the city I will spread my palms" (Bereshit Rabbah 16:2) And all the exiles called by name Egypt on name that they cause anguish to Israel and when they blemish in emunah (faith) , in tefillah (prayer) , in land of Israel he descends to exile and this that our sages, their memory for blessing, said (Sanhedrin 97a) Messiah son of David not come, but until that perutah finished from the purse that is, that the epikorsim that no to them emunah (faith) in miracles and cover all the miracles in way of the nature because when that finished and emunah (faith) multiply in the world then will come Messiah because main the redemption dependent in this as it is written: "Come, gaze from head of Amana" 2. But impossible to come to emunah (faith) except by truth as brought in the Zohar (Balak 198a): "And it will be righteousness girdle of his loins and faith" etc. (Isaiah 11:5) that is righteousness, that is emunah (faith) and they said there: emunah (faith) called, when connected in her truth 3. And impossible to come to truth except by approaching to tzadikim and go in way of their advice and by that he receives from them their advice is engraved in him truth as it is written "Behold truth you desired" (Psalms 51:8) when you desire truth "In inward parts and in hidden wisdom you make me know" (Psalms 51:8) because the advices that he receives from them he aspect of marriage and coupling and when receiving advices from wicked he aspect of marriage in the klipah and this is "The serpent deceived me" (Genesis 3:13) language of marriage advices of the serpent that she received he aspect of marriage and by marriage injected in her impurity and at standing of Mount Sinai ceased their impurity (Shabbat 146a) because there they received 613 advices of holiness (Zohar Yitro 82a) and was to them marriage in holiness and why called advice in aspect of marriage ? because (Berakhot 61a) the kidneys advise and kidneys they instruments of the birth, instruments of the seed found, when receiving advice from man as if receiving from him seed and all according to man if wicked or tzadik and for this the Torah weakens power (Sanhedrin 26b) and called tushiyah because they 613 advices as it is written "To me advice and tushiyah" (Proverbs 8:14) and advices they in place of marriage aspect of coupling the weakening power and advice of the tzadik he all seed truth and this interpretation "And I planted you sorek" (Jeremiah 2:21) aspect of the redemption as it is written "I will whistle to them and gather them" (Zechariah 10:8) and by what ? by: "All seed truth" (there in Jeremiah) [completion of the verse "And I planted you" above] by advice of tzadikim come to truth and by this called emunah (faith) , when connected in her truth and by this come the redemption as above because he receives drops of the intellect of the tzadik by advice that he receives from him and this: "Behold truth you desired in kidneys" in the kidneys "Wisdom you make me know" that I merit to receive drops of the brain, drops of the intellect by advice that I receive from them and then I merit to truth because the drops of the intellect called "all seed truth" 4. And know, that by mitzvah of tzitzit the man is saved from advice of the serpent from marriage of wicked from aspect of licentiousness because tzitzit guard to licentiousness as brought in the Tikkunim (tikkun 18): "And took Shem and Yafet the garment and placed on shoulder of both" (Genesis 9:23) this aspect of tzitzit "And nakedness of their father not saw" (Genesis 9:23) because tzitzit covers on naked but Cham, that he evil inclination that heats body of man in transgression he cursed, as it is written (there): "Cursed Canaan" (Genesis 9:25) as it is written (there 3): "Cursed you from all the beast" (Genesis 3:14) and the garment that is tzitzit he guard from advice of the serpent from impurity of the serpent and this aspect of "Son porat on eye" (Genesis 49:22) because tzitzit language of "Peering from the cracks" (Song of Songs 2:9) by this merited to son porat that guarded from marriage of serpent from coupling of the other side and merited to coupling of holiness and this: "porat", language of coupling language of: "Be fruitful and multiply" (Genesis 1:28) and main the licentiousness dependent in the eyes as they said (Sotah 9a): Shimshon went after his eyes and as it is written "And not stray after your heart and after your eyes" (Numbers 15:39) and guard of tzitzit, that he aspect of eyes he guard from advice of the serpent and can to receive the advices from tzadik that he all seed truth 5. And this interpretation: Said Rabba bar bar Chana: Said to me that Arab, come I will show you Mount Sinai. I went and saw that surround to it scorpions, and stand as white donkeys. And I heard bat kol that says: Woe to me that I swore, and now that I swore, who annuls for me Rashbam: "That I swore" from the exile, as written call good in prophets come and show you Mount Sinai that he aspect of advices because there received 613 advices I saw that surround to it scorpion that is that there advice of serpent advice of wicked that by them not can to receive advice of tzadikim, seed truth and stand as white donkeys this aspect of tzitzit that he guard from advice of the serpent, from licentiousness as our sages, their memory for blessing, said (Menachot 43b). Which punishment greater, that of white or that of tekhelet ?

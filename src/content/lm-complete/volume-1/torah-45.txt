FREEDOM - LIBERTY - EMANCIPATION Sunday, August 24, 2025 Likutay Moharan - Torah-teaching 45 Likutay Moharan Volume 1: Torah 45 Likutay Moharan Volume 1: Torah 45 Clapping of Palms in Prayer [In the language of our master, Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, of blessed memory] Behold, striking palm to palm at the time of prayer, this is the aspect of arousal of wings [spiritual faculties], from which speech [expression] comes. As it is written: &#8220;And the owner of wings shall tell the matter.&#8221; [Ecclesiastes 10:20] It is written: &#8220;And hands of a man from under their wings.&#8221; [Ezekiel 10:8] It turns out that through a person&#8217;s arousal in his hands [i.e., clapping them], the wings are aroused&#8212;that is, the wings of the lung [source of breath and speech], from which speech is formed. But still, they [wings/speech] need to prepare and rectify the mouth [organ of speech] to receive the speech within it. Through his striking palm to palm, through this the mouth is formed. For in each hand there are five fingers [digits]. The strikings [claps], which are the lights [spiritual illuminations]: right hand in left hand, that is, five times five, numerical equivalence of twenty-five. The strikings left hand in right hand, five times five, also numerical equivalence of twenty-five. Two times twenty-five, numerical equivalence of fifty. This is the aspect of &#8220;fifty times the Exodus from Egypt&#8221; mentioned in the Torah [linked to spiritual liberation]. For through the aspect of Jubilee [fifty-year cycle of freedom], they went out from the exile of Egypt [Zohar Shemos 46a]. The main aspect of the exile of Egypt was that speech was in exile [restricted expression]. Because of this, Moshe was &#8220;heavy of mouth&#8221; [speech impediment] [Exodus 4:10]. Through redemption [liberation], the aspect of the mouth was formed. It turns out that through the &#8220;fifty gates of Understanding&#8221; [Kabbalistic levels of wisdom], the mouth was formed. This is what is written: &#8220;Who placed a mouth in man?&#8221; [Exodus 4:11] &#8220;Who&#8221; [numerical value 50] precisely. It turns out that through striking palm to palm&#8212;five fingers of the right in the five of the left, and five of the left in the five of the right&#8212;the aspect of &#8220;Who&#8221; is formed, through which the mouth was formed, as it is written: &#8220;Who placed a mouth in man?&#8221; The mouth receives the speeches from the wings of the lung, as it is written: &#8220;And the owner of wings shall tell the matter.&#8221; Wings are aroused by the arousal of the hands of man, as it is written: &#8220;And hands of a man from under their wings.&#8221; All this we see empirically, that the hands are opposite the wings of the lung. Because of this, the halakhic decisors said: &#8220;If the wing broke close to the body, it is invalid&#8221; [Yoreh De&#8217;ah 53] [non-kosher, as the lung was certainly punctured].

      <p>
        For know, that mitzvah [mitzvah – commandment] [root גרר] drags another mitzvah (Avot, Chapter 4), it is found that the mitzvah drags its fellow. And certainly, there is some aspect between the mitzvos that connects one mitzvah to its fellow, through which the mitzvos are dragged one after another [goreret – dragging, from root גרר]. In truth, this aspect itself, namely, that which is between the mitzvos as mentioned above, this aspect is also exceedingly precious. Therefore, one who is a tzadik [tzadik – righteous one] from his youth and walks in the upright path from his days, from level to level, as it is written regarding Avraham (Genesis 24:1): "And Avraham was old, come in days," that Avraham came to his level through the days, as brought in the Zohar (Chayei Sarah, 129a), that at three years old he recognized his Creator (Nedarim 32a), and he was always going from level to level.
      </p>

      <p>
        But one who is in this aspect [bechina – spiritual level], he loses through zealousness. For when he is greatly zealous and runs with zealousness from mitzvah to mitzvah, then he loses through this the aspect of holiness that is between mitzvah and mitzvah as mentioned above. For through this zealousness, he passes over and skips this aspect. Because the mitzvah itself comes to him, as it is drawn and dragged to him through the first mitzvah that drags the second, as mentioned above. And when he also runs with zealousness toward the mitzvah, then he may skip and pass over the aforementioned aspect, namely, that which is between the mitzvos as mentioned above. Therefore, he is zealous and loses. But when he lingers a little, he can, in the meantime, attain also the aspect that is between the mitzvos as mentioned above.
      </p>

      <p>
        And all this is for one who walks in the ways of G-d in order from his youth. But one who needs to do teshuvah [teshuvah – repentance], he must specifically be greatly, very greatly zealous, to hasten and run exceedingly to escape for his soul. And it is forbidden for him to linger at all, to stand and settle, because a baal teshuvah [baal teshuvah – penitent] does not go from level to level at all, and there is no aforementioned aspect between him and holiness. For he needs to begin anew, and he must run and leap toward holiness, as it is brought, that the baal teshuvah must leap over what needs to be leaped over and jump toward holiness with great zealousness. And such a person is zealous and rewarded, as mentioned above.

FREEDOM - LIBERTY - EMANCIPATION Wednesday, August 27, 2025 Likutay Moharan - Torah-teaching 39 Likutay Moharan Volume 1: Torah 39 Likutay Moharan Volume 1: Torah 39 &#8220;And I will give aisav (grass [vegetation]) in your field for your cattle&#8221; [Deuteronomy 11:15] [In the language of our master, Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, of blessed memory] The word aisav (grass [vegetation]) is an acronym [ rashei teivos (initial letters)] for O seh SH alom B imromav (He makes peace in His heights) (עו&#1465;ש&#1462;&#1474;ה ש&#1464;&#1473;לו&#1465;ם ב&#1460;&#1468;מ&#1456;רו&#1465;מ&#1464;יו) . &#8220;In your field&#8221; ( b&#8217;sadkha ) is the language of shidud (plundering [overcoming base instincts]) and shevirah (breaking [nullifying desires]). When a person feels some re&#8217;avon (hunger [physical or spiritual craving]), that the ta&#8217;avas akhilah (desire for eating [craving for physical gratification]) overcomes him, know that he has son&#8217;im (enemies [spiritual or social opposition]), as it is written: &#8220;He who sets shalom (peace [harmony]) in your border&#8221; [Psalms 147:14; Bava Metzia 59a] [indicating hunger reflects spiritual discord] . And one who has rashim (poor [material lack]) below [in this world], it is known that he has rashim (poor) above [in the spiritual realms, causing deficiency in the divine attribute of Kingship] [Sanhedrin 103b]. Therefore, one needs to plunder and break his bahamiyus (animality [base instincts, animal soul]) that desires to eat, for the main aspect of re&#8217;avon (hunger) is to the bahamiyus (animality) [Zohar Beraishis 63a]. &#8220;Pride comes, then comes kalon (disgrace [humiliation])&#8221; [Proverbs 11:2], this is the kalon (disgrace) of re&#8217;avon (hunger), as it is written: &#8220;Which you shall no longer bear the cherpas re&#8217;av (disgrace of hunger) among the nations&#8221; [Ezekiel 36:30]. It emerges that machlokes (dispute [conflict]), that is, what disgraces a person, comes through this aspect of re&#8217;avon (hunger). And this re&#8217;avon (hunger), which is the aspect of machlokes (dispute) and the aspect of cherpah (disgrace), is also the aspect of orlah (foreskin [spiritual obstruction]). As it is written regarding the orlah (foreskin): &#8220;For it is a cherpah (disgrace) to us&#8221; [Genesis 34:14]. The orlah (foreskin) is three klipos (husks [spiritual forces concealing holiness]) that surround the bris shalom (covenant of peace [ bris , sexual purity, spiritual unity]). And when they break the orlah (foreskin) [remove the spiritual obstruction], then the bris shalom (covenant of peace) is revealed. And when there is shalom (peace) below [among people], there is shalom (peace) above [in the spiritual realms], &#8220;in His heights.&#8221; And when there is shalom (peace) above, then great sava&#8217;ah (satiety [spiritual and material abundance]) is revealed and increased in the world, as it is written regarding Yosef: &#8220;Give zera (seed [sustenance]) and we shall live&#8221; [Genesis 47:19]. Another explanation: And I will give aisav (grass) , a hint to sons, as it is written: &#8220;And your offspring like the aisav (grass) of the earth&#8221; [Job 5:25]. &#8220;In your field for your cattle,&#8221; that is to say, when will you have sons who are living and enduring? When your zivug (mating [spiritual or physical union]) will be in kedushah (holiness [sanctified state]), and you break your nefesh hamis&#8217;avah (desiring soul [animal soul]), which is the bahamiyus (animality). And it shall seem to you as if you &#8220;force a shaid (demon [evil force])&#8221; [Nedarim 20b]. And this is &#8220;in your field&#8221; ( sadeh ), the language of a shaid (demon) [sharing the root SH-D ]. Through this [holy zivug (mating) and breaking the bahamiyus (animality)], you will have enduring sons. For the death of sons is because of the neshamos ha&#8217;ashukim b&#8217;tikla (oppressed souls in the balance [Kabbalistic state of spiritual judgment]) [Zohar Mishpatim 113a]. For the tikla (balance [scale of judgment]), which is the klipos nogah (radiant husks [spiritual forces mixed with good]), is close to the nefesh habahamis (animal soul), as brought in Mishnas Chassidim (Tractate of Composition). Also, one needs that the main of your zivug (mating) be on shabbas (Sabbath [day of holiness]) night, for then it is included in kedushah (holiness), and all po&#8217;alei aven (workers of iniquity [evil forces]) separate from it. And this, &#8220;And you shall eat and be satisfied&#8221; (ד&#1468;&#1456;ב&#1464;ר&#1460;ים י&#1524;א:טו) [Deuteronomy 11:15], hints at shabbas (Sabbath), for then there is a sava&#8217;ah (satiety) from which the six days of the week are blessed.

        <strong>The Life of Our Leader Rabbi Nachman</strong> (Chayei Moharan) is the foundational biography 
        written by his close disciple, Rabbi Natan. This profound work documents his holy life, his 
        conversations, his teachings, and the events that shaped his path. Rabbi Nachman (1772-1810) 
        was the great-grandson of the Baal Shem Tov and the founder of Breslov Chassidism.

        <h3>From the Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          "Who will relate the mighty actions of Hashem, make heard all His praise?" (Psalms 106). 
          Who can tell over, who can fathom, all the great, and wondrous, and awesome things done 
          by our master, our teacher, and our rabbi, light of lights, pure, pristine light, the 
          cached, and hidden, and concealed light, with the collective entirety of the souls of 
          Israel, upon whom are contingent all the worlds.
        </p>
        <p>
          And especially that which he accomplished and did with his men close to him who merited 
          to revel in the holy shade of his shadow, and to hear from his mouth what they heard, 
          matters which Atteek Yoamin (Ancient of Days) concealed. And particularly, that which 
          he worked and did with my poor and destitute self, that he erected me from the dust and 
          the dumps, and sat me down next to him, and with his mercy drew me even more, close to 
          him, and placed his hand on me to receive and to write all his words of Torah.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>The Nature of True Life</h3>
        <p>
          The general principle is, that the essential life is the true life which is true wisdom, 
          as it is written (Ecclesiastes 7), "Wisdom give life to its possessor." And the main 
          wisdom is to strive and toil to know and recognize Him Blessed He, for He is life of life 
          (chay hachayim). And everyone, according to his proximity to this, so is his life life, 
          and vice versa.
        </p>
        <p>
          And therefore (Brachos 18b) evil people (even) in their lifetime are called dead, and 
          vice versa, tzaddikim (even) in their death are considered alive, for they are always 
          bound in true life, as it is written (Deuteronomy 4), "And you (plural) who are clinging 
          to Hashem your G-d, you are all alive today."
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>Hisbodidus: The Path to Life</h3>
        <p>
          And he said to his men on the first night of Shavuos: Give your hearts to me and I will 
          lead you on a new path, which is the old path which our forefathers traversed from time 
          immemorial; and he revealed to us that there is no remedy to be saved from the utter 
          overwhelming bad inclination, that always quests and desires to cause man to stumble, 
          except through hisbodidus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Which every person wherever he may be, whenever, and whatever level he may be, as each 
          one knows the wounds of his heart and the pains of his soul, should set for himself a 
          special place to pour out his heart there before Him Blessed He about everything that 
          he is going through, and to request of Him that He should draw him close to His service 
          Blessed He, and He should help him so that he is not ensnared in the net of the Accuser.
        </p>
        <p>
          And he said in this language: "Even when one falls into a mire one screams and screams 
          and screams."
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>The Tikkun Haklali</h3>
        <p>
          Rabbi Nachman revealed that saying the following ten chapters of Psalms together serves 
          as a Tikkun Klali – a general rectification: 16, 32, 41, 42, 59, 77, 90, 105, 137, 150.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many Jews say these every day as a remedy for all problems and as a general spiritual 
          rectification.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>On Speaking Against Others</h3>
        <p>
          One time, on the day before the last Rosh Hashana of his life, someone asked him for 
          advice how to merit to diligence in Torah study. Rabbi Nachman told him that he should 
          not speak (bad) of any Jew.
        </p>
        <p>
          The person asked Rabbainu, what if he sees that he is a completely wicked person? 
          Rabbainu strongly admonished him, how he could suggest that one from Israel is completely 
          wicked, for certainly there is still found in him a bit of good or some good point where 
          he is not wicked.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>The Journey to Israel</h3>
        <p>
          Rabbi Nachman traveled to the Holy Land in 5598 (1798). He visited tzaddikim and holy 
          sites, and the journey deeply affected his spiritual state. Upon his return, he spoke of 
          the tremendous elevation he experienced and the awesome revelations he merited.
        </p>
        <p>
          He traveled by way of Nikolayev and Kherson to Odessa, and he spent Shavuos in Kherson. 
          There he delivered wondrous Torahs and he heard the thundering of the Receiving of the Torah.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>The Final Years</h3>
        <p>
          In the summer of 5567 (1807), Rabbi Nachman's wife passed away, and Rabbi Nachman contracted 
          a lung disease. He immediately began to speak of his own demise. He said his health was 
          in grave danger and exhorted everyone to pray for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He passed away on 18 Elul 5570 (1810) and was buried in Uman, where his gravesite 
          continues to draw thousands of Jews each year, especially for Rosh Hashana.

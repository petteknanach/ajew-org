Introduction

I saw fit to explain and relate a little, a tiny bit of the holy conduct of Rabbainu (-Our Rebbe) Hakadosh (-the holy) vihanoaruh (-and the awesome) of blessed memory, from the day he took hold of his faculties until the day of his passing in peace; a little - what I heard from his own holy mouth, and the little - from other people who knew him from his inception, and a little - what we saw with our eyes.

And even though I know very well that there will be many who will not believe these things, because many rose against him; even still I could not hold back, from the utter force of the imploring and the desire of the many people and wholesome (in greatness or united conviction, see Rashi on Nahum 1:12), who implored to the furthest limit to print a little of it. Also my thoughts answer up to me (Job 20:2) and my kidneys advise me (Talmud Brachos 61a) that behold in any case the practices explained here are holy and very good practices, fortunate is he who holds to them, and it is befitting to inscribe in a book these practices, whomever it may be who performed them, in any case these practices are very good and holy, and how can I withhold the good from those who traverse in unfeigned wholeheartedness, whose souls desire to find in a book these upright ways(?). And also the truth is its own witness, and whoever looks with a true eye at the books of Rabbainu o.b.m. will understand for himself that these things are impossible to attain with human intellect, only by someone holy and pure with exceeding holiness and purity like him; and it is not possible to elongate on this, because it is superfluous, as the world says: either it won't help or it isn't necessary. Therefore my heart went one/once here and one/once there on this matter, and I said: be what may, I will present these words in order that the last generation know, they will rise and tell their children, and from it they will see and they will do, to go in these paths and to traverse in their tracks, because this doesn't need ratification/explanation that practices such as these are holy and precious practices, and each and everyone can draw close to Hashem Yisburach through such practices, because they are equally pertinent to every soul, small or big, and even the least of Israel, if he desires to have mercy on his life and to consider his ultimate eternal tachlis (purpose, end), and he accustoms himself to go in these path and ways which are explained here, certainly he will merit eternal life, and he can come to lofty and holy heights/virtues like one of the binay aleyuh (those who ascend - very saintly people who serve Gd on a very high paradigm), if he will have strong resolve to always hold to his good way like a stake that won't budge, as it is all explained here further on.

However, this should be known, that everything explained here, is not even a drop in the ocean from the utter magnitude of his holiness and his superlative virtue/level, which rises above in the place where the hands of human intellect has no reach. And also it is not our desire to explain a little of the awesome miracles that we saw from him, because we are not engaged in relating his holy praises just what is pertinent to the fear of Hashem. I said: let them see those things, they will take mussar (-ethics), because all the people that see these things in writing by us, all of them will thank, and praise, and glorify them, and their hearts will be touched with great arousal for Hashem Yisburach, and everyone is asking and imploring me to bring them to print. Their words have come upon me as a substantial plea, until I was forced to fulfill their desire. And Hashem Yisburach should have mercy upon us that we merit to go in the ways of our fathers, who did the will of their Creator with fright and fear, until the building of Zion and Jerusalem, and Israel returns like doves to their (window) roosts, speedily in our days, amen.

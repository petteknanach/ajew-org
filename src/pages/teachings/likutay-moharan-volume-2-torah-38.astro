        "Come, behold the works of Hashem, who has made shamos [desolations/names] in the earth" (Psalms 46:9). For in truth, the matter is very wondrous and awesome, that Hashem, blessed be He, created the entire creation, which has many, many very, very wondrous and awesome things. "How manifold are Your works, Hashem". And even in this world alone, the wonders of Hashem are great, who created inanimate and growing things, and so forth. And who can estimate the greatness of Hashem that is in the creatures of this world, how much more so the other worlds. And everything, as everything, was created only for the sake of Israel.
      </p>

      <div class="hebrew-quote">
        לְכוּ רְאוּ מַעֲשֵׂי ה
      </div>

      <p>
        And Israel themselves, the main purpose of their creation is for the aspect of Shabbos [Sabbath], which is the purpose. For Shabbos is the purpose of the work of heaven and earth, which is the aspect of the world of neshamos [souls] (Introduction to the Zohar, folio 1; Zohar, Terumah 136), which is a world entirely Shabbos. And there they will attain Hashem, blessed be He, as is fitting, without any separating veil and without any hindrance. For then there will be complete unity, and each one will point with his finger: "This is Hashem, we hoped for Him", as our Sages, of blessed memory, said (Taanis 31). And this is the purpose, for which Hashem, blessed be He, created the entire creation.
      </p>

      <p>
        And therefore, there is certainly in every single thing that was created in the world the aspect of the purpose, for in every single thing there is a beginning and an end, that is, the beginning from the place where it was emanated in the emanation until it was materialized and formed in this form and likeness. And there is also in it the aspect of the purpose and the end, for which it was created, that is, that Israel can deepen their contemplation and know and understand the details of the creation: in the structure of the limbs and the building and stature and likeness, and so forth.

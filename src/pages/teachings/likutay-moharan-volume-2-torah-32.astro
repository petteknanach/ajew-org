        There are hidden tzadikim [righteous ones], and they know panim [faces/insights] in the Torah, but they must conceal their Torah. And as they relate a story about the Baal Shem Tov with the preacher. And also with him, there are times when he knows a Torah that has panim, that is, panim in the Torah, and he must conceal it and not say it. And sometimes he does not write it at all, and sometimes he writes it and afterward burns it. And in truth, if it were written, it would become a sefer [book] and would come into the world. And also, there are in them shemos [names], the aspect of Shmi [My Name] that is written in holiness, but the world spoils this, and it must be concealed and burned. But it is a benefit to the world that these Torahs and sfarim [books] are concealed and burned.
      </p>

      <div class="hebrew-quote">
        יֵשׁ צַדִּיקִים מְסוּתָרִים
      </div>

      <p>
        For there are also many sfarim that were already made into sfarim and were erased and lost from the world. For certainly, the great tzadikim, the early Tannaim and Amoraim and the like, made many sfarim, but they were lost. But this is a benefit to the world, for if this were not so, it would not be possible for us at all to draw close to Hashem, blessed be He. For there are many heretical sfarim that, if they were, heaven forbid, spread in the world, it would not be possible at all to draw close to Hashem, blessed be He, at all. And therefore, it is a benefit that the holy sfarim mentioned above are concealed and burned.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the sefer is the aspect of Shem Hashem [Name of Hashem], in the aspect of: "A tower of strength is Shem Hashem, in it the tzadik runs and is exalted" (Proverbs 18:10; Bereshis Rabbah 37). Shem Hashem is a sefer, for sefer in number is Shem, as brought, for the sefer is the aspect of Shmi that is written in holiness and is spread in the world and makes a name.
      </p>

      <p>
        And know that every single one must guard the aspect of Moshiach [Messiah] that one has. For every one, according to one's holiness and purity, so one has an aspect of Moshiach. And one must guard very much that the aspect of Moshiach not be spoiled. And the main matter on which the aspects of Moshiach depend is guarding from niuf [licentiousness]. For Moshiach is the aspect of chotem [nose], in the aspect of: "The breath of our nostrils, Moshiach Hashem" (Lamentations 4:20). And niuf depends on the chotem, as it is written: "You shall not commit niuf" (Exodus 20:14).
      </p>

      <p>
        And it is stated in the Midrash (Rabbah, Naso, Parsha 10): "Do not derive pleasure from the nose". And one must guard oneself very much even from the scent of niuf, for it damages the aspect of Moshiach, which is the aspect of chotem, as mentioned above. And the aspect of Moshiach rests upon the anpei oraisa [faces of the Torah], that is, the holy sfarim that reveal the panim of the Torah, and there the spirit of Moshiach hovers, in the aspect of: "And the spirit of G-d hovers over the face of the waters" (Genesis 1:2). The spirit of G-d is the spirit of Moshiach (Zohar, Vayechi 240), which hovers over the face of the waters, and water is the Torah, as brought (Taanis 4; Bava Kamma 17).
      </p>

      <p>
        And know that the aspect of "The breath of our nostrils, Moshiach Hashem" becomes a spirit of kinah [jealousy] that goes and is jealous in every place where it finds niuf. It becomes a spirit of kinah and is jealous for this to increase its holiness and purity. And sometimes "He is jealous, and she is defiled, or a spirit of kinah comes over him… and she is not defiled" (Numbers 5:14). For to increase the essence of its holiness and purity, even though she is not defiled, he is jealous for the mere contradiction, for it is considered a blemish against the essence of the purity of the spirit of kinah. And through this, sometimes a get [divorce document] is made.

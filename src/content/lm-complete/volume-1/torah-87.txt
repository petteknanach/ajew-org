FREEDOM - LIBERTY - EMANCIPATION Tuesday, July 22, 2025 Likutay Moharan - Torah-teaching 87 87 Immediately when a person wants to walk in the upright path [In the language of the ḥaverim (friends)] : "Titen emet le-Yaakov, ḥesed le-Avraham" [&#8220;Give truth to Yaakov, kindness to Avraham&#8221; &#8212; Micah 7:20 ]. The matter is as follows: we see tangibly that immediately when a person desires to walk in the upright path, dinim [judgments] are aroused upon him &#8212; and logically, this appears to be the opposite of what one would expect. However, there are two types of yirah [fear/awe]: yirat ha-onesh [fear of punishment] and yirat haromemut [awe of exaltedness]. Yirat ha-onesh is called tzedek [righteousness], and yirat haromemut is called emunah [faith]. Because when a person believes with complete faith that the Blessed Name is great and sovereign &#8212; the root and essence of all worlds &#8212; he is in awe of Him. And it is known that it is impossible to come to emunah [faith] except by means of yirat ha-onesh [fear of punishment]. For when a person fears punishment, he believes that the Blessed Name is powerful &#8212; the Master of all capacity and of all forces &#8212; and from this, he comes to a greater level of emunah [faith]. It follows that immediately when a person wishes to walk the upright path, he must possess yirah [fear/awe], which is called tzedek [righteousness], as it is written: "VeHu yishpot tevel b&#8217;tzedek" [&#8220;And He shall judge the world with righteousness&#8221; &#8212; Psalms 9:9 ]. Therefore, dinim [judgments] are aroused upon him. But when he reaches the level of emet [truth], that is &#8212; to the form of yirah [awe] which is called emunah [faith] &#8212; then all the dinim [judgments] are sweetened at their root. And this is the meaning of: "Titen emet le-Yaakov" &#8212; that is, to yirah [awe], for Yaakov represents yirah , as it says: "Ekev anavah yirat Hashem" [&#8220;The reward of humility is fear of Hashem&#8221; &#8212; Proverbs 22:4 ]. Then, surely: "ḥesed le-Avraham" &#8212; for Avraham is called one who attaches himself to the Blessed Name, from the expression "Avo Ram" [&#8220;I will come aloft,&#8221; as in the Zohar, Balak 198b]. And it is stated: "V&#8217;hayah tzedek ezor motnav v&#8217;emunah ezor chalatzav" [&#8220;And righteousness shall be the belt of his loins, and faith the belt of his hips&#8221; &#8212; Isaiah 11:5 ]. That is to say: initially, it is called tzedek [righteousness], and only once emet [truth] is joined with it, is it called emunah [faith]. And in that place &#8212; where truth is unified with awe &#8212; all goodness and all light reside. Posted by NaaNaach at 9:13&#8239;PM Email This BlogThis!

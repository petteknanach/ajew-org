he enters the chambers and enters from chamber to chamber and from
chamber to chamber because in every chamber and chamber there are
several several doors to other chambers. And similarly from those
chambers to other chambers. And he enters and strolls in all of them,
and gathers from there treasures and&nbsp;</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><i>segulot</i></font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;[</font></font></font><font color="#0000ff"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">remedies

precious and very desirable. Happy is his portion. But know, that one
needs to be careful very much, not to err in himself, because not
quickly do they merit this because there are several several
innovations that do not come from there only from the halls of
exchanges [</font></font></font><font color="#0000ff"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">counterfeit
realms of impurity mimicking holiness</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">]
because this opposite this G-d made [</font></font></font><font color="#0000ff"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Ecclesiastes
7:14, good and evil parallels</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">].
And even though it seems to the person as a great attainment even so,
also there there are innovations nice that seem as attainments. And
also in this there are several aspects like for example when they
write word Adam they know that this hints at the image of the man but
it is only in hint in general because there is not written there any
drawing of the man. And there is that they draw on the paper the
drawing of the man, and there is revealed more a little the image of
the man. And there is that they saw [</font></font></font><font color="#0000ff"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">carve</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">]
the drawing of the man from a piece of wood and there is revealed
still more the drawing of the man. But even so this is not the man
actually only the man himself is the man in truth. Similarly there
are several innovations of Torah that they are only like a notebook
and like that they write the word Adam alone because the Torah is the
aspect of Adam, as it is written:&nbsp;</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><b>“This
is the Torah Adam”</b></font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;[</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><i>Numbers</i></font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;19:14&nbsp;</font></font></font><font color="#0000ff"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">&quot;This
is the law when a man dies&quot;</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">].
And there is that he enters inside from this but even so this is not
Adam as above only when they merit to the Torah itself this is the
aspect of Adam in truth. And this is&nbsp;</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><b>“This
is the Torah Adam”</b></font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;this
the Torah precisely that is only this the true Torah, is the aspect
of Adam. And know that every person before he attains in the Torah an
attainment of truth needs to go necessarily through these halls of
exchanges. But the rule that it is forbidden to err in himself to
think that already he came to the proper attainment because if he
thinks so he will remain there G-d forbid. But when he knows that
still he has not begun to enter the true chambers of Torah then he
will strengthen in the service of Hashem, and increase in prayers,
and implore until they open for him the gates of holiness in truth,
and then he will see the difference. And even if he did fasts and
mortifications and afflictions for the sake of Hashem blessed be He
and after that merited to innovations even so he should not stand on
this to think that they are attainments of truth the above because
even for the semblances of the halls of exchanges one needs fasts and
mortifications. And even in lusts of this world there is an example
to this like for example when they make a joke and comedy then one
travels and announces and thinks all the things that they will do on
the comedy. And even though it is a lust to hear even so this is not
the joke itself. And similarly when he comes to the chamber where
they make the comedy there is drawn on the board all the things that
they will do there. And also this is not the thing itself. And even
when they come there inside, one jester stands, and does like the act
of a monkey and all the things that the master of comedy does, he
does after him in jest. And also this is not the thing itself. And
the main is the joke itself that they do there. Similarly understand
the parable from itself because there is one who seems to him that he
enters inside, and inside and inside and still stands outside
completely, because he has not begun to attain an attainment of
truth. And the very great&nbsp;</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><i>tzadik</i></font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;even
when he merits to attain great attainments of holiness in truth even
so they are not considered in his eyes as anything because of the
greatness of the essence of his recognition of the greatness of the
Creator blessed be He. Therefore he strives and strengthens each time
that Hashem blessed be He begins to show him the light of the Torah
as if he has not begun to attain at all from his days.</font></font></font></p>

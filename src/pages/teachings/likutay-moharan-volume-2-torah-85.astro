        There is a great need for those who sit in the valley of the shadow of death (Psalms 23:4). For there is no other time like it for Yisrael [Israel]. For at that time, one must have a great and awesome fear. And it is similar to the time of the war of Amalek, as it is written: "And it was when Yisrael was seeding, etc." (Judges 5:6). And "seeding" means Torah, as our Sages, of blessed memory, said (Yoma 35b): "Seed [zera] is Torah," for through Torah, seed is made, etc. For in that time, the sitra achara [other side] comes to nullify the Torah and the seed of Yisrael. But at that time, through great fear and shaking of the heart, one should cleave to Hashem, blessed is He, with great awe and love. And this is the aspect of: "I shall fear no evil" (Psalms 23:4). For the aspect of the evil inclination and the evil eye, etc., come to a person at that time. But one should not be afraid at all, for Hashem, blessed is He, is with him, and He will save him.
      </p>

      <div class="hebrew-quote">
        צֹרֶךְ גָּדוֹל לְיוֹשְׁבֵי עֵמֶק צֵל מָוֶת
      </div>

      <p>
        Therefore, a person should always imagine himself as standing in the valley of the shadow of death, for this is the best segula [remedy] to cleave to Hashem, blessed is He. For when a person knows that he is in great danger, he cleaves to Hashem with all his heart. And through this, he merits to be saved. For there is no other help except in Hashem, blessed is He. And even for those who do not have that aspect of danger, they should imagine themselves as if they are in danger. For this is the aspect of "Prepare to meet your G-d, Yisrael" (Amos 4:12), as our Sages, of blessed memory, said (Eruvin 22a): "Even a poor person in his basket and a rich person at his banquet" [should think] that the Divine Presence is with him.
      </p>

      <p>
        And this is the aspect of the shofar [ram's horn] of the Great Shofar, which is blown on Rosh HaShanah, and its aspect is the great shaking of the heart. And through the shofar's sound, the heart shakes and breaks, and through this, one merits to return in teshuvah [repentance]. And as we say in the prayers: "You will sound the great shofar for our freedom," etc. And all the more so when a person hears the shofar of the Great Shofar, he should imagine himself as standing in the valley of the shadow of death, as mentioned above. And through this, he will merit to be saved from the evil inclination and all the machinations of the sitra achara.

is he who considers the poor; on the day of evil, Hashem will deliver
him&quot; (Psalms 41:2) Explanation (according to the language of the
companions): There is no poverty except poverty of the mind (Nedarim
41a). And for this, one requires great mercy, for there is no greater
mercy than this — both in general and in particular: • In
general, it refers to a person who has no understanding in the
service of the Creator. He needs someone who possesses intellect to
instruct him and help him comprehend. • In particular, it refers to
the person himself, for there are times when even he experiences a
lack of intellect. This is called small-mindedness (katnut
ha-mochin), and he must strengthen himself to arrive at a state of
expanded consciousness (gadlut ha-mochin). When he does reach
greatness of the mind, then all judgments are sweetened, and he draws
upon himself kindness and mercy. This is in accordance with the
statement of our sages, of blessed memory (Berakhot 33a): &quot;Great
is knowledge, for it was given between two Divine Names&quot;, as it
is written: &quot;For the Lord is a God of knowledge, Hashem&quot; (1
Samuel 2:3). Explanation: When one arrives at greatness of the mind,
then mercy and kindness are awakened upon him from the two Divine
Names: • &quot;God&quot; (El) — this corresponds to kindness, as
in: &quot;The kindness of God is all day long&quot; (Psalms 52:3), •
&quot;Hashem&quot; (Y-H-V-H) — this corresponds to mercy, as in:
&quot;Great is Your mercy, Hashem&quot; (Psalms 119:156). Thus, this
is the explanation of the verse: &quot;Happy is he who considers the
poor&quot; — meaning, when he is in a state of mental constriction,
and he directs himself toward expansion of the mind, then: &quot;On
the day of evil, Hashem will deliver him&quot; — for all judgments
are sweetened. And if one is unable by himself to reach expanded
consciousness, then a remedy for this is: That he helps others attain
understanding — and through this, he too will be awakened.</font></font></font></p>

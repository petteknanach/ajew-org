who sacrificed their souls for the sanctification of the Name for the
unification of the Holy One blessed be He and His Shechinah as is
known that the main unification is through self-sacrifice. And they
saw in those generations that it is impossible to repair and to make
unifications above except through their souls. Therefore they
sacrificed their souls for the sanctification of the Name. For when
the souls ascend above through self-sacrifice then they return to the
Shechinah, for from there they came out. For Israel are portion of
G-d from above actually that they are portions of the Shechinah
actually in aspect of&nbsp;</font></font></font><font color="#800080"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><b>&quot;The

known. And sometimes it comes for need this killing, G-d forbid that
are killed, G-d forbid, several several souls from Israel in order
that there be unification through their souls that ascend above. For
sometimes need for the unification many souls very, G-d forbid.
Therefore comes killing, G-d forbid. And similarly through loss of
the Name, that is the famous that is, that there is one that is
famous and is not famous, that is, that he is famous in mouth of all
and all speak from him and even so is not famous, because he is not
considered at all. And there is one that does not desire in this,
only that he lost the famous that is loss of the Name that is even
though not his will that not be famous even so lost it like person
loses thing not in his will, that is, that lost the Name, that aspect
of famous that has name in the world. But there is one that does this
in his will and in his knowledge that sacrifices his soul for
sanctification of the Name that is his famous, that aspect of name as
above, that aspect of soul as above. And because of this even though
he is famous even so he is not famous at all, for on the contrary he
is opposite, for all speak against him, and invent against him lies
that not arose on his mind. And has to him bloodshed actually from
this. And does this in intention, because it is aspect of
self-sacrifice actually because the Name is the soul as above, and
also has to him bloodshed from this as above. And he saves Israel in
this from what was proper to come upon them G-d forbid, for the
unification as above. And through sacrifice of his name that is his
soul as above he saves them as above.</font></font></font></p>

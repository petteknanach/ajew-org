        The light of Torah is a great light, and through it, one can see from one end of the world to the other. For Torah contains all wisdom and knowledge. As it is written: "The Torah of Hashem is perfect" (Psalms 19:8), and our Sages, of blessed memory, said that Torah includes all the wisdom of the world. And this is the aspect of the menorah [candelabrum] in the Temple, which had seven candles, and its light illuminated the entire Temple. Similarly, the light of Torah illuminates the entire world. And through Torah study, one can understand all the secrets of creation and the mysteries of the divine.
      </p>

      <div class="hebrew-quote">
        אוֹר הַתּוֹרָה אוֹר גָּדוֹל
      </div>

      <p>
        And this is also the aspect of the luminaries that were created on the fourth day of creation, as it is written: "And Hashem set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth" (Genesis 1:17). For the luminaries represent the light of Torah, which illuminates the world. And the sun is compared to the Torah, for just as the sun gives light to the world, so too the Torah gives light to the soul. And the moon is compared to the Jewish people, for just as the moon reflects the light of the sun, so too the Jewish people reflect the light of Torah to the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore, one should always study Torah with great devotion, for through Torah study, one merits to see the great light of Torah that illuminates the entire world. And this light is eternal and never diminishes. And through Torah, one can understand the will of Hashem and walk in His ways. And this is the aspect of the redemption, for when the light of Torah is revealed in the world, the redemption will come. For the light of Torah is the light of redemption, and through it, the world will be filled with knowledge of Hashem.

FREEDOM - LIBERTY - EMANCIPATION Tuesday, July 22, 2025 Likutay Moharan - Torah-teaching 67 Likutay Moharan, Torah 67: Vayiven Hashem Elokim Et HaTzela Asher Lakach [And Hashem G-d Built the Rib Which He Had Taken] Vayiven Hashem Elokim et hatzela asher lakach v&#8217;chulu vay&#8217;vi&#8217;eha el ha&#8217;adam [And Hashem G-d built the rib which He had taken, etc., and He brought her to the man] [ Genesis 2:22] One said , it teaches that He gave her extra understanding , and one said , it teaches that He braided her for Chava and brought her to the man [ Niddah 45b]. 1. The soul ( nefesh ) is very precious , and one must be careful with it and guard it greatly . Therefore, one must be very cautious when a new honor ( kavod ) comes to a person , for kavod is the mother of all living , and it is the root of all nefashos . When the nefesh departs , it departs to the kavod , which is its root , in the aspect of, &#8220;The glory of Hashem shall gather you&#8221; [ Isaiah 58:8], that the departure and gathering of the nefashos are into the kavod , for there is their root , as above. Therefore, when a new kavod comes to a person , one must be careful and guard , for perhaps the kavod comes , G-d forbid, for departure , so that the nefesh may depart to the kavod , which is its root , as above. But the measure of good is greater , and therefore usually , the kavod comes for good , that is, when a new nefesh comes to the person , then it comes clothed in the kavod , which is the mother of all living , as above. Therefore, when a new kavod comes to a person , usually it is for good , that is, that a new nefesh comes to the person through this kavod , which is the root of all nefashos , as above. The principle is that kavod is the root of the nefashos , and therefore sometimes a new kavod comes to a person for the sake of the departure of some nefesh , G-d forbid, so that the nefesh may depart to the kavod , as above, but usually , the kavod comes for good , that is, that a new nefesh comes to the person through this kavod , which is the root of all nefashos , as above. Therefore, one must be very cautious to receive the kavod in great holiness ( k&#8217;dusha ), for the sake of His Name , Blessed be He , alone , for the kavod is the root of all nefashos , as above. 2. It is necessary to see that there be face ( panim ) to the kavod , for through the desire for eating , then the kavod is impaired , and it has no face . For a person &#8217;s table is the aspect of the crown of kingdom ( keter malchus ) [ Yoma 72b, see Rashi ], and it is the aspect of kavod , in the aspect of, &#8220;King of glory&#8221; [ Psalms 24:7], for the kavod is the aspect of kingdom ( malchus ). When one impairs in eating , then the kavod is impaired and has no face , as it is written, &#8220;And I will hide My face and he shall be devoured&#8221; [ Deuteronomy 31:17], that through the desire for eating , G-d forbid, it is the hiding of face ( hastaras panim ). But through minimizing eating , which breaks the desire for eating , through this it is the lifting of face ( n&#8217;sius panim ) [ Berachot 20b]: &#8220;Hashem lift His face to you&#8221; [ Numbers 6:26], and &#8220;Why shall I not lift face to Israel, for I said, &#8216;And you shall eat and be satisfied and bless,&#8217; and they are precise from an olive&#8217;s bulk to an egg&#8217;s bulk&#8221; . It is found that through breaking the desire for eating , that they are precise from an olive&#8217;s bulk to an egg&#8217;s bulk , through this it is the n&#8217;sius panim . This is the aspect of, &#8220;And he spoke to me, this is the table that is before Hashem&#8221; [ Ezekiel 41:22], before Hashem specifically, the aspect of the illumination of face ( he&#8217;aras panim ) through the table , that is, through eating in k&#8217;dusha , as above. 3. When one impairs in the desire for eating , and through this the kavod is impaired and has no face , as above, through this the brazen-faced ( azei panim ) strengthen , that is, the kavod , which is the aspect of malchus , falls , and the azei panim of the generation take the kavod [ Sanhedrin 105a]. That is, when the aspect of malchus , the aspect of the table in k&#8217;dusha , is not in completeness , as above, then brazenness ( azus ) strengthens , which is malchus without a crown , without the keter malchus , as above. This is the aspect of, &#8220;And the dogs are brazen of soul, they do not know satisfaction&#8221; [ Isaiah 56:11], that is, through the desire for eating , the aspect of, &#8220;The belly of the wicked lacks&#8221; [ Proverbs 13:25], and this is: &#8220;They do not know satisfaction&#8221; , the opposite of, &#8220;The tzadik eats to the satisfaction of his soul&#8221; (ibid.). Through this, the azei panim strengthen , who are the aspect of dogs brazen of soul , the aspect of [ Sotah 49b]: The face of the generation is like the face of a dog , on the verse, &#8220;And the dogs are brazen of soul&#8221; , as above, &#8220;They are evil shepherds who do not know understanding&#8221; , that they become shepherds and leaders to the generation , for the kavod fell to them, and they have all the kavod . But when they break the desire for eating , in the aspect of, &#8220;The tzadik eats to the satisfaction of his soul&#8221; , through this it is the n&#8217;sius panim , and then there is no appointment and authority for the azei panim , for their suckling is only from the hastaras panim , through the desire for eating , as above. This is, &#8220;And he lodges satisfied, evil will not visit him&#8221; [ Proverbs 19:23], and satisfied lodges , this is the aspect of, &#8220;The tzadik eats to the satisfaction of his soul&#8221; , through this, evil will not visit him , that there is no visitation and appointment for the evil , that is, for the azei panim , as above. 4. When the malchus and the kavod fall to the azei panim , as above, then it is the aspect of justice ( tzedek ). [The letter] tzadik ( צ ) is yud nun ( י נ ), and the yud is the return of face from the nun , like this tz ( צ ), which is the aspect of malchus , the aspect of, &#8220;Before the sun His name shall continue&#8221; [ Psalms 72:17] ( Rashi : yinon, language of kingdom ), that is, the aspect of the hastaras panim , that is, that the kavod has no face , as above. This is the aspect of the dalet ( ד ), that is, that the kavod and the malchus go and diminish , and fall to the other side ( sitra achara ), which are the azei panim , as above, [becoming] kuf ( ק ), that is, when the malchus and the kavod go and diminish , it is like a monkey ( kof ) before a man , that is, that the leg of the hei ( ה ) is lengthened , and becomes kuf ( ק ), that is, that it is lengthened from the leg downward , in the aspect of, &#8220;Her feet go down to death&#8221; [ Proverbs 5:5], and they suck from her, for the kavod and the malchus fell among them, as above, and then it is the aspect of, &#8220;Her feet go down to death&#8221; . That is, the existence of the malchus of k&#8217;dusha must receive from them. Therefore, when Israel need to perform some forcefulness for the need of the existence of our holy religion , they must receive the power and the rule from the malchus of idolatry ( malchus ha&#8217;akum ). 5. It is necessary to raise the kavod and the malchus from them, and this is done through charity ( tzedakah ), in the aspect of, &#8220;Charity saves from death&#8221; [ Proverbs 10:2] [see Zohar Chukat 113a], that is, through tzedakah , they raise and </p>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font color="#333333"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Know
that one needs exactly _vidui devarim_, confession in words—that
is, one must articulate the sin in detail, confessing it verbally
each time, for every individual deed. There are many obstacles:
sometimes the sin is forgotten, sometimes it is difficult or painful
to utter verbal confession, and more.<br/>
<br/>
One needs the joy of
a mitzvah—such as the joy felt at a wedding, or other joyful
mitzvah. Joy corresponds to the full stature of the body: 248 limbs
and 365 sinews. Therefore when one is joyous or dancing, see that the
joy passes from head to foot. Sometimes joy is limited to the legs,
or to the heart, or to the intellect.<br/>
<br/>
Scripture
says:&nbsp;</font></font><font color="#333333"><b>“Everlasting joy
will be upon their head”</b></font><font color="#333333"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;(Isaiah
35:10). The essential joy is that which passes through the entire
stature. To achieve that, one needs many mitzvot, because at the root
of all mitzvot is joy. Psalm 19 says: “The precepts of the LORD are
right, giving joy to the heart.” Every one of the 613 mitzvot has
its corresponding joy-limb. Therefore if one blemishes a
mitzvah—positive or negative—then when joy passes through the
body it will hit the limb corresponding to that mitzvah. If that limb
is blemished, joy cannot flow there, and instead one feels anxiety:
as it is written, “I am troubled by my sin.”<br/>
<br/>
But by
performing many mitzvot—even if someone is a “transgressor,” as
Chagigah 27a states that even the sinners of Israel can be “like
filled pomegranates”—this abundance of mitzvot nullifies the
anxiety that prevents joy. The flourishing joy-light kindles and
cancels the barriers of sin, and then confession becomes
possible.<br/>
<br/>
_Vidui devarim_ repairs the world of speech (cf.
sign 78), for the sin blemish exists in the soul, and the soul
manifests through speech: “My soul went out at his word” (Song of
Songs 5:6). Therefore one must confess verbally in order to repair
and build the blemished speech-aspect. As it says in Hosea 14:2,
“Take words and return to G&#8209;d.”<br/>
<br/>
When speech is
repaired and rebuilt through _vidui devarim_, a holy union arises
between the Blessed Holy One and His Shechinah; the upper voice
awakens and unites with the speech. One also needs a lower awakening:
building speech leads to the awakening and desire of voice, which
unites with the speech—as in Psalms 103:20, “Who do His word,
listening for His word-voice.”<br/>
<br/>
The Zohar (Lech Lecha
90a) teaches that those who merit hearing the upper voices are those
“who do His word,” i.e. who repair their speech—and thus they
merit hearing the word-voice. More wonders include receiving the
melody of voice, song, and musical instrument. Isaiah 51:3 says,
“Gladness and joy shall be found in her, thanksgiving and a voice
of song.” The thanksgiving (aspect of _vidui devarim_) and the
song-voice arise within joy and gladness.</font></font></font></p>

      <div class="hebrew-quote">
        צאו וראו את גבורות אדוניכם<br>
        אשר האיר לנו תורה של מעלה<br>
        להחיותנו כיום מעלה<br>
        לעולם הבא
      </div>

      <p>
        Go out and see the might of your Master, who has illuminated heavenly Torah for us, 
        to enliven us as it is this day, for the everlasting world; and our G-d has not 
        forsaken us in our servitude, but has extended kindness to us in each and every 
        generation, and has sent us deliverers, and rabbis, and tzadikim foundations of 
        the world, to teach us the way.
      </p>

      <p>
        His first mercies have come to pass, and yet His mercies have not ceased at any 
        period or any time. And He has performed kindness for us, drawing water from the 
        wellsprings of salvation, ancient things, words which are the secret of the world, 
        under wonderful and awesome clothings.
      </p>

      <p>
        See, and understand, and look at His wonderful and awesome way, which is an 
        inheritance to us from our holy forefathers who were during ancient times in Israel.
      </p>

      <p>
        For such is the way of the supernal holy one, harvesters of the field, who raised 
        their hands and hearts to G-d, to clothe and conceal the King's treasure houses in 
        story tales, according to the generation and according to the times, knowing the 
        understanding of times, to know what Israel should do, until Messiah arises and 
        delivers Zion and returns to build the ruins of Ariel.
      </p>

      <p>
        At such time it will be said [by the ministering angels] to Jacob and to Israel 
        [who shall again excel in belovedness by Hashem, before everyone's eyes, and sit 
        before Him, learning Torah from His mouth, such that their place is more near than 
        that of the ministering Angels], "What has G-d wrought?"

performed His word [Lamentations 2], he tore His purple (Midrash
there) because certainly the Temple cannot bear His glory and His
pride, blessed be He, as it is written (1 Kings 8): &quot;Behold the
heavens and the heavens of heavens cannot contain You how much less
this house&quot; etc. only because of the love of Israel He
contracted and clothed His pride in order to rest His Shechinah in
the Temple in order to reveal His kingship, and this is aspects of
(Psalms 93): &quot;G-d reigns pride He has donned&quot; that as if in
order to reveal His kingship He clothed and contracted His pride in
order that we can bear receiving His kingship upon us, but when
Israel sinned before Him then as if He showed and revealed Hashem,
blessed be He, His pride and His grandeur and did not want to clothe
it and contract it anymore and automatically the Temple was destroyed
because it could not bear it as above, and this &quot;He performed
His word&quot; he tore His purple that He tore the clothing of His,
that is that He tore the clothing and the contraction above aspects
of &quot;pride He has donned&quot; above and automatically the Temple
was destroyed because after He tore and nullified the contraction and
the clothing again the Temple cannot bear His pride and His grandeur
because &quot;behold the heavens and the heavens of heavens cannot
contain You&quot; as above. Also I heard in His name regarding the
above that He clothed and contracted His pride in order to reveal His
kingship that He said then what He said on the day before it and the
matter, that fear aspects of kingship is aspects of submission and
this that is written (Deuteronomy 10): &quot;What does G-d your G-d
ask from you but to fear&quot; that Hashem, blessed be He, diminishes
Himself as if and asks from them fear because asks from you, it is
aspects of submission and lowliness, like the asker and requester
from his friend (Avos chapter 3) &quot;If not for the fear of
kingship&quot; (as brought already several times). And kingship is
aspects of poor and submission because there is no king without a
people, that this is aspects of poverty that has nothing of its own
(as brought in another place) that is that the attribute of kingship
has nothing from its side except by the world the attribute of
kingship is revealed because there is no king without a people it is
found that the attribute of kingship that it is aspects of fear, it
is aspects of poor and submission and therefore at the time of the
giving of the Torah that He wanted Hashem, blessed be He, to reveal
His kingship and His fear He humbled Himself Hashem, blessed be He to
Israel as if and requested from them that they should accept His
kingship and promised them several promises, as it is written (Exodus
19): &quot;And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy
nation&quot; etc. that all these promises are aspects of submission
and all this was for the fear that it is aspects of kingship as it is
written (there 20): &quot;And in order that His fear be on your
faces&quot; etc. because all this was for the fear that it is aspects
of kingship as above because Hashem, blessed be He diminishes Himself
in order to reveal His kingship as above and this is: &quot;G-d
reigns pride He has donned&quot; G-d reigns that is when Hashem,
blessed be He, wanted to reveal His kingship then &quot;pride He has
donned&quot;, that He donned and contracted His pride and diminished
Himself as if as above. Also heard, that He said then words of
clarity to a preacher that sat at His table then He performed His
word that says Torah for gain and money also from the like of the
above, heard in His name, that He said on the verse (Jeremiah 23) &quot;If
a man hides in hiding places and I do not see him&quot; because when
a person diminishes himself then Hashem, blessed be He also
diminishes Himself but when the person is proud and enlarges himself,
then Hashem, blessed be He also shows His pride and greatness and
this is: &quot;If a man hides in hiding places&quot; that when the
person diminishes and hides himself in hiding places that is that he
hides and conceals and diminishes himself in humility and lowliness
then &quot;and I do not see him&quot;, that I also show Myself to him
in aspects of not that it is aspects of nothing and zero in aspects
of humility and lowliness, and as above.</font></font></font></p>

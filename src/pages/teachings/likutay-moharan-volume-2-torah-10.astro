        That which the world is distant from Hashem, blessed be He, and do not draw near to Him, blessed be He, is only because they lack settlement of mind [da'at] and do not calm their minds. And the main thing is to strive to settle oneself well: What is the ultimate purpose of all the desires and of all the matters of this world? And then certainly one will return to G-d.
      </p>

      <div class="hebrew-quote">
        כִּי עִמְּךָ הַסְּלִיחָה לְמַעַן תִּוָּרֵא
      </div>

      <p>
        But know, that through sadness [black bile] one cannot direct the brain [moach] and mind [da'at] as desired, and therefore it is difficult to settle one's mind [da'at]. Only through joy can one direct the brain [moach] and mind [da'at] as desired, and settle one's mind [da'at]. For joy is the world of freedom, the aspect of: "For with joy you shall go out" (Isaiah 55:12), that through joy one becomes free and goes out from exile. And therefore, when one binds joy to the brain [moach] and mind [da'at], then the mind [da'at] is liberated, free from the state of exile. And then one can direct one's brain [moach] and mind [da'at] as desired and settle one's mind [da'at], since the mind [da'at] is in freedom and not in exile. For through exile the mind [da'at] is not settled, as our Rabbis, of blessed memory, expounded on the children of Ammon and Moab, that their mind [da'at] was settled because they did not go into exile, as it is said: "Moab has been at ease from his youth," etc., "and has not gone into exile, therefore his taste has remained in him," etc. (Jeremiah 48:11; Megillah 12b).
      </p>

      <p>
        And to come to joy is through what one finds in oneself some good point in any case, as explained on the verse: "Then I will sing to my G-d while I yet exist" (in Likutay Moharan I, Torah 282), see there. To rejoice in that which one merited to be from the seed of Israel, that He did not make me a gentile, and as we say: Blessed is our G-d who created us for His glory, and separated us, etc., and gave us the Torah of truth, etc. From all this and the like [Israelite identity, Torah], it is fitting for one to draw joy to gladden one's mind [da'at] as above (Shabbat 77b), cheerfulness of mind [bedicha da'ateih], a great virtue, binds joy to the brain [moach] and mind [da'at]. And then the mind [da'at] is liberated and one has settlement of the mind [da'at] as above. And also above, a great unification is made from this through cheerfulness of mind [bedicha da'ateih].

        The principle is that the main purpose is only to serve and walk in the ways of Hashem for His sake, blessed be He, in order to merit to know Him, blessed be He, and to recognize Him, blessed be He. This is the main purpose, and this is His will, blessed be He, that we recognize Him, blessed be He. And it is not fitting for a person to have any other intention in his service of Hashem, blessed be He, except to fulfill His will, blessed be He, that His will be done.
      </p>

      <p>
        For there is one who serves all his days and pursues the desires of this world in order to fill his belly and stomach with the desires of this world. And there is one who serves and strives in order to merit the World to Come. And this too is called filling the belly, that he wants to fill his belly and his desire with the World to Come. And this is the aspect of: "Their portion in life, and Your hidden treasure fills their belly". Chelkam [their portion] in life and tzefuncha [Your hidden treasure], that is, those who choose their portion in life, that is, to fulfill their desire in their life in this world, and those who choose the great good that is hidden, that is, the World to Come. And both of them are the aspect of filling their belly, that they want to fill their belly and their desire, this one in this world and that one in the World to Come. Only that the one who chooses the World to Come is wiser, for he chooses an enduring, eternal world and rejects this world that passes and perishes. And also in truth, it is certainly much better to serve Hashem even if one serves for the sake of the World to Come.
      </p>

      <p>
        But I do not choose for myself from these two groups mentioned above, except to merit to behold the pleasantness of Hashem. And this is: "I, in righteousness, shall behold Your face", that David the King, peace be upon him, said that he chose for himself only to merit in his righteousness to behold the face of Hashem and to recognize the Creator, blessed be He.

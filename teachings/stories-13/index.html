Once there was a king who had an only son. The king wanted to transfer the kingdom to his son during his lifetime, so he threw a grand party (which is called a 'ball'). Now, when the king throws a ball, there is certainly great merriment, so especially now that he had transferred the kingdom to his son during his lifetime, there was certainly a very grand celebration. And there at the ball, were all the royal officers, and all the dukes, and gentry. And it was very merry at the ball. And the country also had enjoyment from this, that the king is transferring the kingdom to his son in his lifetime, since it a great honor for the king. So a very great celebration took place there, and there were all types of festivities there: music bands ('kappelliess'), and comedies, and so forth, as well as anything that is used just for merriment, it was all there at the ball.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-w4g25d6j>And when they had already become very merry, the king got up and said to his son, "Being that I am a stargazer, I see that you will at some time descend from the kingship, therefore see to it that you have no sadness (i.e. no grief) when you descend from your reign, instead you should be happy; and if you will be happy, I will also be happy. Even if you will have sadness, I will still be happy that you are not king, since you are not fit to be king if you cannot keep yourself happy (in other words, if you are the kind of man that you cannot keep yourself happy even when you fall from your reign, then you aren't fit to be any sort of king); but when you will be happy, then I will be extraordinarily happy.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-w4g25d6j>The king's son took up the reign very sharply and appointed his own royal ministers, and he had dukes, and ministers, and soldiers. Now, this son of the king was a wise man and loved wisdom very much, and there were very great intellectuals by him. And whoever came to him with some sort of wisdom, was very esteemed by him, and he would grant them honor and riches for their wisdom. Whatever each one wanted, he gave him: one wanted money – he gave him money; another wanted honor – he gave him honor; anything for wisdom. And because studying was so important to him, they all took to wisdom, and the entire country was occupied with wisdoms, because this one desired money – in order to get money for it, and that one desired status and honor. And because all of them were busy only with wisdoms, therefore they all forgot there, in that country, the strategies of war (in other words, how to wage war), for they were all busy exclusively with wisdoms, to such a degree that the smallest person in that country was (-would be) the greatest sage in another country, while their own wise men were utterly phenomenal scholars. And on account of their wisdoms, those wise men of the country fell into heresy, and drew the son of the king too into their heresy, albeit the simple folk were not harmed and did not become disbelievers. For there was great depth and subtlety in the sages' wisdom – so the common folk were not able to enter into their wisdoms; therefore it did not harm them – only the wise men, and the king's son became heretics.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-w4g25d6j>And the king's son, because there was good in him, for he was born with goodness and had good character traits, would frequently remind himself, "Where in the world am I? What am I doing?" etc. and would make a very big groan, and sigh deeply over it. He would ponder, "How is it possible I should be carried away with such things?! What is going on with me? Where am I in this world?" as he kept sighing intensely. However, as soon as he began to use his intellect, again the heretical philosophy became strong by him. This happened numerous times, that he would still contemplate where in the world he is, what he is doing, etc. as above, with groaning and sighing, but as soon as he began to use his intellect, the heretical belief became strong by him again, as above.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-w4g25d6j>And the day came to pass, there was a flight in a certain country – everyone fled, and as they were fleeing, they went through a forest, losing two children there, a male and a female; someone lost a male, and someone lost a female. And they were still little children of four or five years. The children had nothing to eat, they screamed and cried because they didn't have anything to eat. Meanwhile, there came up to them a beggar, going along with his sacks (which are called 'torbes'), carrying bread in them, and these children started to cling to him and bond with him. He gave them bread and they ate. He asked them, "From where have you come here?"</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-w4g25d6j>They answered him, "We don't know," for they were little children. And he started going away from them, and they asked him to take them with him.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-w4g25d6j>He said to them, "This I do not want, that you should go with me." Meanwhile they took a look – the beggar is blind! It was a marvel to them: since he is blind, how does he know how to go? (And in truth, this itself is a novelty, that such a question occurred to them, for they were still young children. However, they were clever children; therefore it was a wonder to them.) He (this blind beggar) blessed them, "You should be as I am; you should be as old as I," and he left them more bread, and went away. And the children understood that Hashem Yisburach was watching over them, and had sent them here a blind beggar to give them food.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-w4g25d6j>Afterwards the bread ran out (by them), and again they started screaming for food. Then it became night, and they passed the night there. In the morning they still had nothing to eat, so they screamed and cried. Meanwhile, again a beggar came, who was deaf; they started to talk to him, and he showed them with his hands, and said to them, "I hear nothing whatsoever." And this beggar also gave them bread to eat, and started to leave them. They also wanted him to take them with him, but he did not want. And he too blessed them, "That you should be as I am!" and also left them bread, and went his way.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-w4g25d6j>Later on the bread also ran out by them, and again they screamed as above. Again a beggar came to them who was inarticulate (i.e. he stammered with his mouth). They began to speak with him, and he mumbled his words, so they didn't know what he was saying, and he did know what they were saying, only they did not know what he was saying, because he stammered. This beggar also gave them bread to eat, and also started to go away, and also blessed them that they should be like him, and went away, as above. Then there came again a beggar who had a crooked neck, and also the same transpired as before. Then there came again a beggar who was hunchbacked (who is called a 'hoykeyr'). Then there came again a beggar without hands. Then there came a beggar without feet. And each one of them gave them bread and blessed them that they should be like him, just as the other beggars as mentioned above.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-w4g25d6j>Afterwards the bread yet again ran out by them, and they started walking toward a settlement, until they came to a road. They went with that road until they came to a village. They (these children) went into a house, and they had pity on them, and gave them bread. They continued into another house, and there they gave them bread as well, so they kept going around into houses, and saw it was good, to be given bread. The children decided between them that they should always be together, and they made for themselves large sacks (which are called 'torbes') and went around to the houses, and went to all happy occasions, to circumcisions, and to weddings. And they continued further along, going into cities, to the houses; and went to market fairs, and would sit among the beggars, in the same way they sit there on the banks of earth ['prizbes'] with a plate for collecting alms ['teller'], until these children became famous already among all the beggars, since they all recognized them and knew of them; that they were the children who had been lost in the forest as mentioned.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-w4g25d6j>One time there was a big fair in a big city, and all the beggars went there, and the children also went there. It occurred to the beggars that they should match the children; that they should marry each other. And as soon as they started to discuss it, they were all very pleased with it, and they made the match. But how can they make them a wedding? They came to the decision, inasmuch as on such and such a day the king would have his birthday feast (which is called a 'myenines' [-Slavic myena – name, lit. 'name day']), all the beggars would go there, and from what they would request for themselves there, meat and bread, they would make a wedding. And so it was; all the beggars went to the myenines and begged meat and bread for themselves, and also collected what was left over from the banquet, meat, and bread which is called kolitch [big loaves special for celebrations]. And they went ahead and dug out a big trench which could hold a hundred people, and covered it with sticks, earth, and trash. And they all went inside and made a wedding there for the children. Setting up a chuppa (wedding canopy) for them, and they were very, very happy there; and the groom and bride were also extremely happy. The groom and bride began to recall the kindness Hashem Yisburach had done for them when they were in the forest, and started crying and yearning greatly, "How can the first beggar, the blind one, who brought us bread in the forest, be brought here?"</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-w4g25d6j>And just as they were longing very much after the blind beggar, meanwhile he [Heb. only: immediately] called out, "I am here. I have come to you for the wedding, and I'm presenting you with a wedding-discourse present (which is called a 'drashah geshenk'), that you should be old as I. For previously I had blessed you with this, that you should be old as I; now I present it to you as an absolute gift, drashah geshenk, that you should live as long as I. You think that I am blind, I am not blind at all, except [Heb: all the time of] the whole world does not amount by me to the blink of an eye (thus he appears blind, for he doesn't peek into the world whatsoever, even as a blink of an eye, therefore no vision nor any glimpse of the world at all, is relevant to him), because I am very old, and I am yet entirely young and have not yet begun to live at all – but I am still very old. And it is not I alone that says this, rather, I have an approbation on this from the great eagle. I will tell you a story. (All this the blind beggar said).</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-w4g25d6j><em data-astro-cid-w4g25d6j>Content continues in original source...</em></p> </div> </div> </section>

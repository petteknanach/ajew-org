FREEDOM - LIBERTY - EMANCIPATION Sunday, July 20, 2025 Likutay Moharan - Torah-teaching 6 Likutay Moharan 6 Call Joshua [In the language of our Rebbe, his memory for blessing] And Hashem said to Moshe, call Joshua etc. (Deuteronomy 31:14) 1. Because every man needs to diminish in his own honor and to increase in the honor of the Place (see Tikkunei Zohar tikkun 13, Midrash Rabbah Ba 80:4) because one who pursues after honor does not merit to honor of G-d but to honor of kings, that is said in him "Honor of kings search a matter" (Proverbs 25:2) and all search after him and ask. Who is this and what is he, that they give him this honor and dispute on him that say that he is not worthy for this honor but one who flees from the honor that diminishes in his own honor and increases in the honor of the Place then he merits to honor of G-d and then people do not search on his honor if he is worthy or not and on him is said "Honor of G-d conceal a matter" (Proverbs 25:2) because forbidden to search on this honor 2. And impossible to merit to this honor except by teshuvah and main teshuvah when he hears his disgrace, he is silent and quiet because there is no honor without kaf (Zohar Pinchas 255a there and in Tikkunim) and the kaf is keter aspect of Ehyeh aspect of teshuvah because Ehyeh this I am ready to be that is before the teshuvah still he has no existence as if still not formed in the world because good for him that not created than that created and when he comes to purify himself and to do teshuvah then he is in aspect of Ehyeh that is that will be to him existence in the world that is I am ready to be and this aspect of keter because keter language of waiting aspect of teshuvah as our sages, their memory for blessing, said (Yoma 38b 39a) one who comes to purify they help him. Parable to one, that came to buy balsam they say to him: wait etc. and this aspect of keter as it is written "Crown for me a little and I will show you" (Job 36:2) but before the teshuvah then aspect of Ehyeh in concealment of face from him because still not prepared himself to be in the world and concealment of face of Ehyeh gematria dam that is bloodshed and disgraces on name "And despisers are despised" (1 Samuel 2:30) because still the blood that in the left chamber that in the heart, that there dwelling of the evil inclination as it is written "And heart of fool to his left" (Ecclesiastes 10:2) still it in strength and might and for this come upon him disgraces and bloodshed because this aspect of concealment and return of face of Ehyeh, gematria dam [interpretation: because behind of name Ehyeh it in gematria dam, as brought. that is when write the name backwards that is a, ah, ahi, ahyeh, that return each time backwards it in gematria dam and this aspect of return and concealment of face of Ehyeh, that ascends dam] and repair for this, that he turn dam to dom that will be from those hearing their reproach and not replying and not precise on disgrace of his honor and when he fulfills dom to Hashem then the Holy One blessed be He fells for him corpses corpses as it is written "Be silent to Hashem and wait for Him" (Psalms 37:7) and He will fell for you corpses (as our Rabbis z"l expounded Gittin 7a) that is: "And my heart corpse within me" (Psalms 109:22) that is by this is diminished the blood that in the left chamber and this aspect of slaughter of the evil inclination and by this merits to divine honor as it is written "One who slaughters thanksgiving honors Me" (Psalms 50:23) and our sages, their memory for blessing, expounded (Sanhedrin 43b) on slaughter of the evil inclination 3. And needs to hold always in attribute of teshuvah because who will say: "I have made my heart innocent, I am pure from my sin" (Proverbs 20:9) because at the time that a man says: I have sinned, I have transgressed, I have rebelled even this impossible to say with pure heart without bias [and this is: who will say: "I have made my heart innocent, I am pure from my sin" that is who can say that his heart pure and clean from biases even at the time that he says: I have sinned etc. and this is: "I am pure from my sin" that is that will be pure from the I have sinned, I have transgressed, I have rebelled that he said because also then he not pure and clean without biases, as above] found, that needs to do teshuvah on the first teshuvah that is on I have sinned, I have transgressed, I have rebelled that he said because on him is said "With his lips he honored Me" (Isaiah 29:13) because by teshuvah merits to honor of Hashem "And his heart far from Me" (Isaiah 29:13) and even if a man knows in himself, that he did complete teshuvah even so needs to do teshuvah on the first teshuvah because from the beginning when he did teshuvah he did according to his attainment and after that certainly when he does teshuvah certainly he recognizes and attains more the Name blessed be He found according to his attainment that he attains now certainly his first attainment it aspect of materiality found, that needs to do teshuvah on his first attainment on that he materialized the exaltation of His divinity and this aspect of the world to come that will be all Shabbat, that is all teshuvah as it is written "And you return to Hashem your G-d" (Deuteronomy 30:2) because main world to come it attainment of His divinity as it is written "And they know Me from their small to their great" (Jeremiah 31:33) found at every time that they attain additional attainment then they do teshuvah on the first attainment and this that our sages, their memory for blessing, said (there in Sanhedrin). All who sacrifices his inclination that is aspect of teshuvah aspect of: "And my heart corpse within me" aspect of dom to Hashem aspect of Ehyeh aspect of keter aspect of honor, as above and confesses on it that is that confesses on sacrifice of his inclination that is that does teshuvah on his teshuvah and his first attainment as if he honored the Holy One blessed be He in two worlds because teshuvah the first aspect of honor of this world and after the teshuvah that he merits to additional attainment and recognizes more the exaltation of His divinity and does teshuvah on his first teshuvah this teshuvah it aspect of honor of the world to come that the first honor is made frozen and light against the second honor and this that says the Holy One blessed be He (Psalms 50:20). "These you did and I was silent, you thought to be I will be like you" because the man by that he is silent is made aspect of Ehyeh, as above but the Holy One blessed be He, what that He is silent to the man this not for Ehyeh, G-d forbid because this not applicable at the Holy One blessed be He this only in order that they receive their punishment in the world to come that then arrange before his eyes his iniquities and reprove him to his face and this: I will reprove you and set before your eyes 4. And when a man wants to go in ways of teshuvah needs to be expert in halakhah and needs to have to him two expertises that is expert in running, expert in returning as it is written fortunate who enters and exits (Zohar Vayakhel 213a, Haazinu 292b) and this aspect of "If I ascend heaven there You" (Psalms 139:8) aspect of enter aspect of expert in running "And make bed Sheol behold You" (Psalms 139:8) aspect of and exit aspect of expert in returning and this is (Song of Songs 6:3): "I to my beloved and my beloved to me" I to my beloved, this aspect of enter and my beloved to me this aspect of and exit [and this secret of in</p>

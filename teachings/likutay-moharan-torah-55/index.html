Know that to see the downfall of the wicked is impossible except
through the aspect of the Land of Israel: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>Sit
at My right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Psalms 110; see Zohar Lech Lecha 86a]. The right hand—this is the
aspect of the Land of Israel, the aspect of Binyamin (Benjamin), son
of the right hand, who was born in the Land of Israel [as brought in
Rashi on parashat Vayishlach].</font></font></font></p>

To draw down the aspect of the holiness of the Land of Israel now in
exile—where it is under the dominion of the Other Side (sitra
achra), and its holiness lacks the ability to be revealed—even so,
it is possible to reveal and draw down its holiness even in this
bitter exile: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>And
even also this, when they are in the land of their enemies</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Leviticus 26]. That is, even in this bitter exile, it is possible to
reveal the aspect of &quot;also this&quot; (gam zot). And by what
means can one draw down the holiness of the Land of Israel? Through
the sparkling of the light of the merit of the forefathers [Zohar
Shelach 174a]: In the place where the forefathers are present, there
the Shechinah (Divine Presence) is present [there]. </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>And
I will remember My covenant with Jacob, etc., and the land I will
remember</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Leviticus 26]. When the light of the merit of the forefathers
sparkles, then the holiness of the Land of Israel is revealed. And
not only is the person saved from the wicked, but he also sees in the
wicked what the wicked wanted to see in him.</font></font></font></p>

For the wicked draw down the aspect of the evil eye upon those they
hate, in the aspect of [Berachot 7a]: And not only that, but he sees
[something negative] in those who hate him. A person is saved from
this evil eye through studying [and finding] merit—that is, by
learning merit on behalf of the wicked. For even the Holy One,
blessed be He, teaches merit on behalf of the wicked in order to save
the tzadik from the evil eye of the wicked. And this is what our
sages, of blessed memory, said [there]: And not only that, but he
merits in the judgment, as it is said: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>The
height of Your judgments is before him</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Psalms 10:5]. This &quot;meriting&quot; in the judgment—where
merit is taught on his behalf—through this, the tzadik is saved
from the evil eye of the wicked. For to remove the judgment and the
trial, this requires the revelation of the Hand [of G-d], in the
aspect of: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>And
My Hand shall grasp the judgment</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Deuteronomy 32:41]—so that it does not rule over the wicked. And
when the Hand of Hashem is revealed, then a shadow is created in
which the tzadik is covered from the poison of the evil eye, in the
aspect of: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>And
in the shadow of My Hand I have covered you</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">

gaze, they see me</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Psalms 22:18]. Through the shadow, the light of their eyes dims and
darkens, so that their poison cannot harm. But for the tzadikim, the
light of their eyes in this time is small, in the aspect of: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>Who
is blind like the one who is paid [i.e., the servant of G-d]</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Isaiah 42:19]. And through the shadow, the light of their eyes is
strengthened—like those with weak vision who cannot see well when
the light is strong and great, and they need a shadow in order to
see. And this is: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>The

[Psalms 121:1]. He sees and attains the righteousness of Hashem,
blessed be He, and can know and understand that Hashem is the
Tzadik—even though the wicked merits in judgment, and this seems
not in accordance with the measure of justice. He sees that the
justice by which the Holy One, blessed be He, justifies the wicked in
judgment—this is His righteousness: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>For

And through the strengthening of the tzadik's vision—where he sees
the righteousness of Hashem—his faith is strengthened, and he can
pray. For his heart spreads out from its crookedness that it had
before he saw the righteousness of Hashem. For through the
righteousness of Hashem that he sees, the heart spreads from its
crookedness and is straightened, in the aspect of: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>And
Your righteousness to the upright of heart</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[there]. For initially, his heart was crooked from believing
completely in Hashem, blessed be He, for it seemed to him that the
Holy One, blessed be He, had distorted the judgment, G-d forbid. But
now that he sees the righteousnesses of Hashem, his heart is
straightened in the completeness of faith. Then he strengthens
himself and prays for his needs, for the main part of prayer is
through faith—that he believes that everything is under the
authority of the Holy One, blessed be He, even to change nature. And
the Holy One, blessed be He, does not deprive the reward of any
creature, for Hashem is righteous [Psalms 119:137]: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>I
thank You with uprightness of heart</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Psalms 119:7]—through the uprightness of heart, which is the
aspect of faith, the aspect of prayer is created. And this is the
aspect of the red heifer (parah adumah), as stated in the Zohar
[Chukat 180a]: The heifer that receives from the ox. The heifer—this
is the aspect of prayer, in the aspect of: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>And
we will render the bulls of our lips</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">

<font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">5.
And this is the aspect of dust and ash mentioned in the red heifer.
For the aspect of prayer requires the aspect of dust and ash, for one
must subdue the evil—both in particular and in general—under the
good, in the aspect of: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>And
you shall trample the wicked, for they shall be ash under the soles
of your feet</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Malachi 3:21; see Zohar Pekudei 237a]. And this is the aspect of ash
that exists in the aspect of prayer. And &quot;foot&quot;—this is
the aspect of prayer, in the aspect of: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>My
foot has stood, etc.</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Psalms 26:12]. The evil in particular—that is, his gross and
material body—he nullifies at the time of prayer, like the early
pious ones who, at the time of prayer, experienced a divestment of
materiality [see Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 98]. And the evil in
general—that is, the prayers of the transgressors of Israel with
whom he prays—he nullifies their evil and makes from the evil a
throne for holiness. And the dust in prayer—this is that he binds
himself, in general and in particular, with the souls (nefashot),
spirits (ruchot), and higher souls (neshamot) of the dwellers of
dust, and awakens them in his prayer so that they pray with him, in
the aspect of: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>Awake
and sing, dwellers of dust</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Isaiah 26:19]. And this is: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>He
puts his mouth in the dust</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Lamentations 3:29]—meaning that he binds his speech with the
dwellers of dust, as above. And this is what Abraham said in his
prayer: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>Behold,
please, I have ventured to speak to Hashem, and I am dust and ash</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Genesis 18:27]—for this is necessary for the aspect of prayer. And
this is called prayer in public (tefillah b'tzibur), for the letters
of tzibur are the initials of tzadikim (righteous), beinonim
(intermediates), reshaim (wicked). The beinoni—he is the one
praying, as stated by our sages, of blessed memory [Kiddushin 40a]: A
person should always see himself as if half meritorious, etc.
Tzadikim—this is the aspect of dust; reshaim—this is the aspect
of ash, as above. And to awaken the dwellers of dust—this exists in
particular and in general. In particular—that is, the parts of his
own nefesh, ruach, and neshama that have already come in
reincarnation and been rectified. And the nefesh, ruach, and neshama
of other dwellers of dust—to awaken them so that they pray with
him. And this is the aspect of seven by seven mentioned in the red
heifer, for all its matters are seven [in Zohar Acharei 76a and in
Midrash Rabbah parashah 19]: seven washings, seven priests, etc. This
is the aspect of prayer, in the aspect of: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>Seven
times a day I have praised You</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">

<font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">6.
One also needs to rectify in his prayer the aspect of three voices:
</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>The
voice of a fool in a multitude of words</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Ecclesiastes 5:2]. And the aspect of: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>A
voice of response I hear</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Exodus 32:18]. And the aspect of voice, in the aspect of: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>All
day my disgrace is before me, etc., from the voice of the reproacher
and blasphemer</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Psalms 44:16-17]. And this is the aspect of the cedar wood, hyssop,
and scarlet thread mentioned in the red heifer. Cedar—this is the
aspect of the voice of a fool in a multitude of words, in the
multitude of conducts and false beliefs that are the aspect of the
ways of the Emori (Amorites), for </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>The
simpleton believes every word</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Proverbs 14:15]. And this is the aspect of cedar, in the aspect of:
</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>And
I destroyed the Emori, whose height was like the height of cedars</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Amos 2:9]. The tall in stature—according to their multitude, they
are fools, for because of the height of their stature, the vapors
that rise from the heart to the brain to be cooked in the brain and
formed into thoughts—these vapors weaken due to the great distance
from the heart to the brain because of their tall stature, and they
lack the ability to form intellectual thoughts from them. Because of
this, the tall in stature are fools. And this is the aspect of the
ways of the Emori, which have no intellect because of &quot;for his
height is like the height of cedars.&quot; For this reason, they
believe in many false beliefs. And the short in stature—their
vapors are well-cooked and formed into intellectual thoughts, but
because their intellect exceeds their good deeds, in the aspect of
[Avot chapter 3]: Anyone whose wisdom exceeds his deeds—by this,
when the intellectual thoughts return to their heart, their heart
lacks the power to contain the intellect, for the main strengthening
of the heart is through good deeds: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>To
acquire wisdom, but no heart</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Proverbs 17:16]. And through this, their intellect causes them to
sin, and these are the philosophers who lack a good and pure heart
[see Avot chapter 2; Psalms 51:12], and they are not in the aspect
of: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>In
my heart I have hidden Your word, so that I will not sin against You</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Psalms 119:11]. Because of this, their intellect causes even more
sin. And they are in the aspect of: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>Hyssop
that comes out from the wall</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[1 Kings 5:13]. Hyssop—this is the aspect of the short in stature;
they are possessors of intellect, but the heart cannot conceal the
power of the intellect within it, for their heart is weak and
lacking—especially the adulterers who engage in the wisdom of
philosophy, which greatly damages them, for their heart is lacking,
in the aspect of: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>He
who commits adultery with a woman lacks heart</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Proverbs 6:32]. And this is &quot;hyssop that comes out from the
wall&quot;—that is, from the walls of the heart, where the
intellect emerges through the walls of the heart, and the heart
cannot contain the intellect within it, in the aspect of &quot;in my
heart I have hidden,&quot; etc. And this is the aspect of: &quot;A
voice of response I hear&quot;—a voice of reproofs and blasphemies
[as brought in Rashi there], for they blaspheme upward with their
wisdom, as known [Ecclesiastes 7:16]: And do not be overly wise. And
scarlet thread—this is the aspect of the third voice that a person
experiences in disgraces and reproofs from haters, in the aspect of:
</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>All
day my disgrace is before me, and the shame of my face has covered
me, from the voice of the reproacher and blasphemer</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Psalms 44:16-17]: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>And
I am a worm and not a man, a reproach of man and despised by the
people</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Psalms 22:7]. And this is slaughter, burning, gathering mentioned in
the red heifer, which are these three aspects. Slaughter—this is
the aspect of nullifying the faith of fools, in the aspect of: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>And
the slaughter of the deviants has deepened</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Hosea 5:2]. Burning—this is the aspect of strengthening the heart,
so that it can contain the words of wisdom within it, in the aspect
of: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>My
heart grew hot within me</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Psalms 39:4]—for when the words of intellect are restrained in the
heart, the heart becomes heated, for the intellect is like a confined
fire [see Jeremiah 20:9]. And this is burning. Gathering—this is
the aspect of nullifying the disgraces of haters, in the aspect of:
</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>G-d
has gathered my reproach</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Genesis 30:23]—this is the aspect of nullifying the third voice,

And all this, the one praying needs to rectify in his prayer: to
elevate those who have fallen into false beliefs, to raise them in
his prayer to true faith, which is prayer; and to establish in their
hearts complete faith; and to rectify the hearts of the
investigators, the wise men of philosophy, so that their hearts can
contain their intellect and not cause them to sin, in the aspect of:
&quot;In my heart I have hidden,&quot; etc. And this is accomplished
through the intention of the heart in prayer, which rectifies their
hearts. And to transform all disgraces and reproofs—to turn them
into honor. For when a person stands in the palace of the King and
nullifies himself completely, seeing nothing but the King, certainly
when he hears some reproach or disgrace, he interprets the reproach
and disgrace as an explanation of honor to the King. For how is it
possible for someone to enter the palace of the King and disgrace the
King? Rather, certainly these words are words of honor. He
contemplates the words—how to interpret and combine them so that
honor to the King is formed from them. And he does not think that
perhaps these reproofs are said about him—this is not so, for who
is he? Behold, his existence is nullified, and there is nothing here
but the King Himself. And this is: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>And
in His palace, all says glory</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Psalms 29:9]—all the sayings must be combined to form glory from
them. And at the time of prayer, the person stands in the palace of
the King: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>Adonai,
open my lips</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Psalms 51:17]—Adonai, this is the palace [Tikkun 18, 31a].
Therefore, one must make from all disgraces combinations of honor to
the King.</font></font></font></p>

And through prayer as its rectification, the light of the merit of
the forefathers sparkles, in the aspect of the merit of the
forefathers having weakened [see Zohar Shelach, aforementioned in
letter 2]. And this is accomplished through prayers as their
rectification, for the merit of the forefathers weakened through: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>And
Moshe beseeched, etc.</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Exodus 32:11]—through the aspect of prayer. And in the place where
the forefathers are, there the Shechinah is—in the aspect of
challah (portion separated from dough), which is &quot;also this&quot;
(gam zot). Also the aspect of challah, which is the measure of 43
eggs. And this is the aspect of the inheritance of the Land of
Israel, for this mitzvah they were commanded to perform immediately,
as it is written: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>And
it shall be when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall raise up
an offering from the first of your doughs; challah you shall raise up
as an offering</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Numbers 15:19-20; see Sifri, brought in Rashi there]. For in the
place where the forefathers are, there the Shechinah is—that is the
aspect of challah—she is the Land of Israel. And through the aspect
of the Land of Israel, not only is one saved from the evil eye of the
wicked, but he also sees in them what they wanted to see in him [see
Psalms 73]—that they attained more than what they desired. And now,
through &quot;and he beseeched,&quot; through the weakening of the
merit of the forefathers, through the challah offering, through the
Land of Israel, their heart becomes: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>A
drawn-out hope is a sickness of the heart</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Proverbs 13:12]. And this is: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>Hope
in Hashem and keep His way</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Psalms 37:34]—this is the aspect of the rectification of prayer,
the aspect of treading the bow, the aspect of prayer. And they are
the three colors of the bow, which are the light of the forefathers
that sparkles, as above. Through this: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>And
He will exalt you to inherit the land</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">—this
is the aspect of the Land of Israel. And through this: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>When
the wicked are cut off, you shall see</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">—the
aspect of &quot;sit at My right hand,&quot; etc., as above. And this
is: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>Dwell
in the land and pasture faith</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Psalms 37:3]—through faith, which is prayer, through this one
comes to the aspect of the Land of Israel.</font></font></font></p>

And know that not every person can rectify the aforementioned voices
in his prayer, for sometimes the aforementioned voices in his prayer
emerge from such great wicked ones that anyone who stands against
them endangers his soul. And this requires a great prayer, like the
prayer of Moshe Rabbeinu, peace be upon him. Even Moshe Rabbeinu,
peace be upon him, feared Og, king of Bashan, for Og's grasp was
adjacent to the right hand, which is the Land of Israel—until the
Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moshe: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>Do
not fear him</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Numbers 21:34]. For he said: Behold, My right hand has been
removed—as brought in the Zohar [Chukat 184a]. And Og's grasp was
on the right, as he was from the sons of Abraham's household, and his
land was adjacent to the Land of Israel. For this reason, Moshe
feared provoking him—all the more so for other people, who must
greatly examine themselves and understand the root of the wicked, how
his grasp is, whether he can provoke him and destroy him. And this is
what Abba Shaul said: I was a burier of the dead—that his striving
was always to see the cutting off of the wicked, who in their lives
are called dead [Berachot 18b]. Once, I ran after a deer—for the
main downfall of the wicked is through the inheritance of the Land of
Israel, through drawing down the holiness of the Land of Israel, in
the aspect of &quot;sit at My right hand,&quot; etc., as above. And
the Land of Israel &quot;is a deer to all lands&quot; [Ezekiel 20:6].
And I entered the hollow of a dead person—that is, he wanted to
rectify the aforementioned voices. And I ran after it three
parsangs—that is, the aspect of prayer, which consists of three
prayers. Through them, the light of the three forefathers sparkles,
which are in the aspect of the feet of the throne—in order to draw
down the light of the Land of Israel, which is the aspect of the deer
aforementioned. And the deer I did not reach, and the hollow did not
end—that he did not attain the aspect of the Land of Israel, the
nullification of the aforementioned voices. And when I returned to my
back—that is, after the completion of my prayer, when a person
steps back three steps—they said to me: It is that of Og, king of
Bashan. And no person can rectify such voices, for his grasp is on
the right, and even Moshe Rabbeinu feared before him until the Holy
One, blessed be He, assured him: Do not fear him—as brought in the
Zohar [there]. And for this reason, the aspect of a wicked one like
Og is called a refugee: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>And
the refugee came</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Genesis 14:13]—this is Og [Bereishit Rabbah Lech Lecha parashah
42; see Nidah 61a and Tosafot there; see Midrash Rabbah Devarim
parashah 1]—who wanted Abraham to be killed and to take Sarah. And
he is in the aspect of: &quot;The wicked watches the tzadik—Abraham,
etc.—Hashem will not abandon him into his hand,&quot; in the aspect
of: &quot;And My Hand shall grasp the judgment.&quot; And the Holy
One, blessed be He, suppressed his judgment from him for a long time
until the time of Moshe Rabbeinu, peace be upon him. For this reason,
he is called a refugee, in the aspect of: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>And
I escape forever from my judgment</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Job 23:7]—that he escaped from judgment for a great time. And
through this, the tzadikim—who are doers of good—merit before
Hashem, for before the cutting off of the wicked, the face of Hashem
was covered and hidden in the doers of evil in order to cut them off,
in the aspect of: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>The
face of Hashem is against those who do evil, to cut off</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Psalms 34:17]. And now, immediately when they see the cutting off of
the wicked, immediately the face of Hashem is revealed to the doers
of good. And this is: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>Seek
His face always</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Psalms 105:4]—for through &quot;always&quot; (tamid), which is the
aspect of the Land of Israel [see Rashbam on Shochtim there], as it
is written: </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>Always
the eyes of Hashem your G-d are upon it</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[Deuteronomy 11:12]—through the Land of Israel, you will merit to
find the face of Hashem, for through the Land of Israel, you will
merit to see the cutting off of the wicked, as above. And this is the
aspect of the generality of the angel Sandalphon within the angel
Metatron, Prince of the Face—the generality of Asiyah (World of
Action) within Yetzirah (World of Formation)—through doubling the
verse </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><b>Let
every soul</b></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">
[as brought in the Kavvanot]. In every breath and breath, one must
praise Hashem [Bereishit Rabbah parashah 14]. And through the evil
eye, the breath is doubled—as seen sensibly when a person has an
evil eye, then he yawns and opens his mouth to receive a double
breath. And when the breath is doubled, the praise also needs to be
doubled, as above—and in particular, one must praise and thank
Hashem for saving him from this evil eye, and he sees the cutting off
of the wicked. And this is the aspect of Metatron, Prince of the
Face, illuminating to Asiyah—that is, the doers of good merit the
face of Hashem, as above, through the cutting off of the evil eye
that caused the doubling of the breath [up to here, in the language
of our rabbi, of blessed memory].</font></font></font></p>

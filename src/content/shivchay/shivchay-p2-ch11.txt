And immediately after they (-the two men) embarked from Istanbul, the aforementioned agent came to him (-Rabbainu) and showed him many letters from the tzadikim of the generation which they sent to him with the request that he should help the people that travel from here to there (-Israel), because he is influential in the eyes of the royal ministers.

"Therefore know: If you reveal to me who you (- plural) are and from which family you are - it is fine, but if not - I have the power to do with you bad which you will not be able to amend, and no fortune of monetary bribes will help; and not only will you not travel to the Holy Land, you will also be in jail," and similar words like these.

And when Rabbainu o.b.m. heard this, he immediately told him the truth, that his name Rabbi Nachman, and he is a grandson of the Baal Shem Tov o.b.m. and of Rabbi Nachman of Hordainke o.b.m.. Immediately the aforementioned agent retreated and left him, and on the morrow the agent came with subservience to him, and he said to Rabbainu o.b.m. in an expression of love and fondness: "Rebbe, Hashem is with you! Know, that all the benefits/favors you will receive from me, and your reward is double for this, that you revealed to me the truth, because if you would not have admitted to me, I would have given you over to the jail, and I would have been punished in this world and in the next world; and I request of you (-respectful plural) to receive goodness from me, whether it be with purchasing passage on the boat, or with other things, because I am ready and prepared to serve you."

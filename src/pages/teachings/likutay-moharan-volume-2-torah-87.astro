        Torah was given with fear [yirah] and love [ahavah]. Fear from the right side and love from the left side. For Torah is compared to water, wine, and milk (see Nedarim 39b), as it is written: "Like milk to drink, etc." (Ezekiel 24:18). Water is like fear, wine is like love, and milk is like a combination of both. For milk has within it the aspect of blood and the aspect of water, as explained elsewhere. And the right side is fear, and the left side is love, as our Sages, of blessed memory, said: "Right is mercy, left is severity." And also fear is mercy, as it is written: "The fear of Hashem is to hate evil" (Proverbs 8:13), and all good is included in fear. And love is also mercy. But fear is specifically from the right, and love is specifically from the left. For the right side is the aspect of gevurah [strength/judgment], and the left side is chesed [kindness]. But chesed is love, and gevurah is fear. For through gevurah, fear is aroused, and through chesed, love is aroused. And Torah comes with fear and love, from both sides, as it is written: "From His right hand, a fiery law for them" (Deuteronomy 33:2). The fiery law is Torah, and "from His right hand" is fear, and "a fiery law" is love. And it is also written: "Your eyes shall see your teacher" (Isaiah 30:20), and our Sages, of blessed memory, said: "That the teacher should be on your right and the disciple on your left." And so the left is the aspect of love.

      <p>
        Therefore, when a person studies Torah, he should have both fear and love. Fear is for the right side, and love is for the left side. And through both, he can receive the Torah. For Torah requires both aspects. And when he has both, he merits to receive the Torah. And this is what our Sages, of blessed memory, said (Avos 3:9): "If there is no Torah, there is no derech eretz [proper conduct], and if there is no derech eretz, there is no Torah." For derech eretz is the aspect of fear and love, as our Sages, of blessed memory, said (Bava Metzia 30a): "What is derech eretz? To buy and sell," but that is physical derech eretz. But the derech eretz that is connected to Torah is the aspect of fear and love, as mentioned above. For without fear and love, one cannot hold onto the Torah. And through fear and love, one can receive the Torah.

And in the matter of breaking all the bad traits, he was inordinate with very, overly superlative holiness, and he related a vignette regarding breaking anger, and he said, that in the beginning he was very, very greatly choleric, and afterwards, because he wanted to be a kosher man as is His will blessed He, he began to break this trait of anger, until he merited to break this trait of anger; but the acme of breaking this vice turning it around completely, that is, to turn it around to absolute good, that he should not be bothered at all whatsoever by anything, and be just good without any facet of grievance in the world - this he merited just in the land of Israel, there he merited to this, that the anger was abnegated in the utmost nullification, and he merited and became mamash (-really, actually) good, and no facet of grievance in the world remained in him, to the extent that afterwards, even someone who would do to him all the evils of the world, ‎he did not have in his heart any facet of hatred or grievance against him, on the contrary, he would love him, and he would not have anything in his heart against him whatsoever, because he was just entirely good mamash. And the greatness of the enormity of the superlative trait of his goodness was renowned to all who knew him, because he was just entirely good without any facet of grievance and anger whatsoever, just completely good, and this he merited in the land of Israel as mentioned above.

And it is already explained in his holy books a Torah-teaching on this, that specifically in the land of Israel one merits to this aspect, which is the aspect of Erech Apayem (t.n. these are two of the 13 Divine attributes enumerated in Exodus 34:6 and are most simplistically translated as taking long to anger, that is, extremely placid and equable. However Erech Apayem is also the Hebrew for Erech Anpin - the crown Divine partzuf-countenance translated literally as Long Faced (and it is the anthropomorphic home of all the Thirteen Divine Attributes which correspond to thirteen areas of the beard), and it is in this paradigm where everything is good and there is no trace of evil, and it is hence the root of all good temperament, and this is the paradigm Rabbainu keyed into and ascended), the opposite of anger and wrath, and it was for this Moshe Rabbainu desired (to enter) Israel etc., as it is written (Exodus 34:8), "And Moshe hurried and he bowed with his face to the ground;" and our Rabbis of blessed memory (Sanhedrin 111a) expounded: what did he see? - he saw Erech Apayem etc., see there.

And of the attribute of humility he boasted of himself immensely, that he is humble in the acme of humility, and he said, there is no one that merits to true humility except someone who is on this level that he can say of himself that he is humble, like Moshe Rabbainu r.i.p. who wrote of himself (Numbers 12:3), "And the man Moshe was very humble more than all mankind etc.," and like we find in the words of our Rabbis of blessed memory (Sotah 49b, and see all of this in Likutay Moharan, Torah-teaching 147), that Rav Yosef said: "Do not list (amongst the forgone traits) humility, because there is I;" and he of blessed memory was in this aspect, and he posted of himself of his enormous virtue/height in the attribute of humility in the utmost complete (self) nullification.

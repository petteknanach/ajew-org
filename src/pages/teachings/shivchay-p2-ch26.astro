      <p>And on their voyage from Galutz to their home, they traveled by way of the Holy community of Yas (-Iasi the second largest city of Romania), and there was a big epidemic there (-of typhus), and they had great suffering in every single city and in every single town. And it was also difficult to cross the grenets (-border, in Yiddish) because of this, because then, even holding up quarantine wasn't effective for this from these types of places.</p>
      <p>And Hashem Yisburach was to their succor, and they were saved from everything, from pestilence, and sword (-war), and famine, and thirst, and captivity, for all of these they had experienced. And with the kindness of Hashem they escaped from all of them, and they came to their house in peace, peace in his body, peace in his money, and peace in his Torah, because he merited to wondrous hasaga (-spiritual conception) in the Land of Israel, extremely enormous and lofty, infinite to no end and no tachlis (-purpose).</p>

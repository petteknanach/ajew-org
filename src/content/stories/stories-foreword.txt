        Rabbi Nachman's Stories of Ancient Times
        
        
            Go out and see the might of your Master, who has illuminated heavenly Torah for us, to enliven us as [sure as] it is this day, for the everlasting world; and our G-d has not forsaken us in our servitude, but has extended kindness to us in each and every generation, and has sent us deliverers, and rabbis, and tzadikim foundations of the world, to teach us the way. His first [mercies] have come to pass, and yet His mercies have not ceased at any period or any time. And He has performed kindness or us, drawing water from the wellsprings of salvation, ancient things, words which are the secret of the world, under wonderful and awesome clothings. See, and understand, and look at His wonderful and awesome way, which is an inheritance to us from our holy forefathers who were during ancient times in Israel.
            For such is the way of the supernal holy one, harvesters of the field, who raised their hands and hearts to G-d, to clothe and conceal the King's treasure houses in story tales, according to the generation and according to the times, knowing the understanding of times, to know what Israel should do, until Messiah arises and delivers Zion and returns to build the ruins of Ariel, at such time it will be said [by the ministering angels] to Jacob and to Israel [who shall again excel in belovedness by Hashem, before everyone's eyes, and sit before Him, learning Torah from His mouth, such that their place is more near than that of the ministering Angels], "What has G-d wrought?"

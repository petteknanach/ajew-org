There once was a king. In his home there was a<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>bondmaid who served the queen. (Generally no cook may enter into the king's<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>presence, but this bondmaid had some other service, a minor service.) The time<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>came when the queen was supposed to have a child, and the bondmaid had to give<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>birth at that time as well. The granny [Yid. bubbe, Heb. midwife] went and<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>switched the infants to see what would happen; what would arise from this. So<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>she took the king's child and put him down next to the bondmaid, and the<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>bondmaid's son she placed next to the queen.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>Afterwards the children began to grow up, and the king's<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>son (i.e. the child who grew up at the king's, whom they thought was the king's<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>son) they exalted (i.e. they made great) and lifted up always higher and higher<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>until he became extremely great and became a big person. And the bondmaid's son<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>(i.e. he who was reared by the bondmaid, who in truth was the king's son) also<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>grew up at the maid's, and both children studied together in one schoolroom.<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>And the king's true son (who shall be called "the bondmaid's son"),<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>his nature was drawn to the manners of royalty, except that he was brought up<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>in the home of the servant.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>Conversely, the bondmaid's son (who shall be called<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>"the king's son"), his nature was drawn to a different deportment not<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>like the bearing of a king, except that he was brought up in the king's home so<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>he had to act according to the manners of a royal person, because those were<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>the manners they brought him up with.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>Now the granny, because women's minds are fickle [i.e.<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>women are light-minded], in other words, they cannot hold themselves back, went<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>and spoke out the secret to some person, inasmuch as she had exchanged the<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>children. Every person has a friend, and that friend has another friend, thus<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>one person told the other until the secret was revealed, as the way of the<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>world is, until the world was talking quietly about it, that the king's son was<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>switched. But it was not permissible to speak about it outright, so that the<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>king should not become aware of it, for what will the king be able to do in<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>such a case since he cannot correct it? For he cannot believe it, as perhaps it<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>is a lie, so how can one reverse the exchange? Therefore one certainly may not<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>say it out in front of the king; however, amongst themselves the public talked<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>about it quietly.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>The day arrived when someone came along and told (out) the<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>secret before the king's son, how they say about him that he was exchanged.<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>"However, you cannot investigate this, for it does not befit you. And how<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>can one probe such a thing? Just, I am telling it to you in order that you<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>should know, for perhaps there will be a conspiracy against the monarchy; the<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>conspiracy will be able to grow stronger through this, for they will say that<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>they are taking for themselves the king's son as a king, that is, the one who they<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>say of him that he is the king's true son, as mentioned before. Therefore you<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>need to outwit the fellow." (All this, that person said to the king's son<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>who in actual truth is the bondmaid's son, as mentioned).</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>The king's son went (i.e. the one who is called the king's<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>son; and the rule is that wherever simply "the king's son" is<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>mentioned, it refers to the exchanged son, that is, he's actually the<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>bondmaid's son, except that he is called the king's son because he was raised<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>at the king's; and similarly with the "bondmaid's son" where a<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>bondmaid's son is mentioned: only where "the king's true son" or<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>"the bondmaid's true son" is mentioned, then the meaning is the<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>actual truth) and began to do shenanigans to the other one's father (who was<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>really his own father), and arranged everything to constantly do him evil. And<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>he kept dealing him devilry, one after another, in order to force him to uproot<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>himself along with his son. Now, the whole time the king himself was still<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>alive, he did not yet have such an authority; nonetheless he kept dealing him<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>woes.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>Afterwards the king grew old and died, so he (i.e. the<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>bondmaid's son who is now called the king's son, as mentioned above) assumed<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>the reign; then he dealt even more evil to the other son's father (i.e. to the<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>father of the bondmaid's son who in truth was the king's son, and the father<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>was really the own father of the one who had taken up the reign, for they were<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>exchanged, as above) and he dealt him evil disguised so that people would not<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>know that it's from him, for it's unseemly in front of people, and always dealt<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>him devilry, time and again.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>This one [the son's father] understood that he is doing<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>chicanery on account of the matter (i.e. because the public discusses that the<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>children were exchanged). He spoke up and said to his son (i.e. the<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>bondservant, the bondmaid's husband who was constantly dealt woes, in order<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>that he should drive out his son because they say that the children were<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>exchanged, as mentioned) - and told him the whole affair, and said to him,<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>"I have great pity on you, for anyway you approach it: if indeed you are<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>my child, of course I certainly have great pity on you; if indeed you are not<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>my child, but in truth the king's son, there is even greater pity on you,<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>because that one (i.e. he who took over the reign) wants to expel you entirely,<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>perish the thought. Therefore you must pull out (i.e. run away) from<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>here." He was very ired, and by him this matter was extreme iniquity.<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>However, the king (i.e. the one who became king in place of his father, because<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>it seemed he is the king's son due to the exchange) meanwhile kept constantly<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>dealing out woes, one after another, so the son (i.e. the king's true son who<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>was exchanged) decided he must run away. His father gave him a great deal of<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>money and he left.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>It upset him very much that he was driven out of his<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>country for nothing, for he looked around: "Why do I deserve this, that I<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>should be driven out? If indeed I am the king's son, I certainly don't deserve<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>this, that I should be driven out. And even if I am not the king's son, I also<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>don't deserve this, that I should be a fugitive (i.e. one who has run away) for<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>nothing. For, what is my sin? What am I guilty of here?" It upset him very<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>much, and on account of this he took to drinking and went to brothels (i.e.<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>into the rooms where whores stay). And with that he wanted to spend the time of<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>his years, getting drunk and following after what his heart desires, because he<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>was driven away for nothing. And the king (i.e. the false prince, the exchanged<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>one who became king) took over the reign powerfully. And when he heard anything<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>about people murmuring and discussing anything about it (i.e. that they were<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>switched, as mentioned) he penalized (in other words, punished and tortured)<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>them, and took his revenge on them. So he ruled with force and strength.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>And the day came to pass when the king went with his<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>noblemen on a hunt ("na ulavi" - Rus.: i.e. catching animals) and<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>they came to a pleasant place. And a stream of water was before that place, and<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>they stopped there to rest themselves, and wanted to walk around. The king lay<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>down for a little bit, and the deed that he had done, that he had driven away<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>that certain one for nothing, came to his mind. For, anyway you look at it: if<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>he is indeed the king's son, is it not enough that he was exchanged? Why should<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>he additionally be driven out for nothing? And if he is not the king's son, he<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>also does not deserve to be driven away, for what had he done wrong? The king contemplated<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>to himself this matter, and had remorse over the transgression and the great<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>injustice that he had done; and the king could give himself no recourse what he<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>should do here. And to talk about it - one cannot do such a thing with any<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>person whatsoever, to take counsel with him (for one is obviously ashamed to<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>discuss such a thing with people), so the king grew very concerned with great<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>worry. He ordered the nobles to turn back, because since worry had befallen<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>him, there was no need to stroll about any longer. They returned home. When the<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>King returned home, he obviously had many affairs and concerns, and he busied<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>himself with his concerns, and the issue (i.e. the worry and the remorse that<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>he had over the fact that he had driven away the other one for nothing) left<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>his mind.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>And the one who was driven away (i.e. the king's true son)<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>- well, he did what he did and squandered his money. One time, he went out<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>alone for a walk; and he lay down and it came to his mind what had happened to<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>him, and he thought: "What has G-d done to me? If I am indeed the king's<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>son, I certainly don't deserve this, and if I'm not the king's son, I also<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>don't deserve this (very thing); that I should be a fugitive and an<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>exile." Afterwards he came to a resolution of this mind: "Just the<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>reverse. If it is so, that Hashem Yisburach can indeed do such a thing, that<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>they should exchange a king's son, and such things should befall him - do I<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>turn myself to behave this way?! Is it right, what I have done? Does it befit<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>me that I should behave thus, the way I have done?" And he began to have<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>great anguish and strong remorse over the evil deeds he had done. Then he<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>turned back home, there where he was staying, and further took to drinking.<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>However, because he had already began to have remorse, the thoughts of remorse<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>and repentance that came to his mind all the time would confuse him.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>One time he laid himself down to sleep and he dreamed how<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>in such and such a place there is a fair on such and such a day; therefore he<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>should go there, and whatever he strikes first - any gainful service - he<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>should immediately do it, even if it won't be according to his dignity (thus<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>went his dream). And he woke up with a start, and the dream was very much in<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>his thoughts - for sometimes it happens that the matter immediately leaves the<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>conscious - but rather, this dream very much entered in his thought. Albeit,<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>nonetheless, it seemed very hard for him to do this, and he went and continued<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>drinking. And the dream appeared to him again several times, and the dream<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>confused him greatly.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>One time they said to him in the dream, "If you want<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>to have pity on yourself, do it" (i.e. he should go to the fair etc. as<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>mentioned), so now he had to carry out the dream. And he went and gave away the<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>remaining money he still had; he gave it away to the inn where he was staying,<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>and the good clothes which he still had, he also left at the inn [in the book<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>The Life of Rabbi Nachman, item #61, Rabbi Nachman clarified that this was not<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>for payment to the inn. Rabbi Nachman said that this little detail and every<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>little detail of these stories are extremely critical], and he took for himself<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>a simple garment like merchants', that is, a coverall ['apintche'], and<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>he journeyed to the fair. And he arrived there, and he got up entirely early,<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>and went to the fair.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>A certain merchant encountered him and said to him,<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>"Would you like some work?" He answered him, "Yes." He said<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>to him, "I need to drive animals here. Will you hire yourself out to<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>me?" And he didn't have time to settle his mind due to the dream (for the<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>dream had been that he must take on the first gainful work etc. as mentioned),<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>and immediately answered, "Yes." And the merchant immediately hired<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>him, and immediately begin to lord it over him like a master over his servants.<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>And he began to look at himself, what he had done, for he certainly doesn't<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>deserve such servitude, for he is a delicate man, and now he'll have to drive<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>animals, and he'll have to go along with the animals by foot. However, it was<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>too late to have any regret, and the merchant bossed over him like a master. He<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>asked the merchant, "How shall I go alone with the animals?" He<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>answered, "I have more herdsmen driving my animals. You will go together<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>with them." And he gave over to his hands certain animals to drive; he led<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>the animals out of the town, and there the rest of the herdsman who drive<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>animals gathered together, and together they went along. And he drove the<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>animals, and the merchant was riding on a horse and proceeding with them. And<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>the merchant was riding cruelly (i.e. with anger and without compassion), and<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>against him he was extra cruel, and he grew more and more terrified of the<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>merchant, since he saw in him that he has extremely great cruelty and anger<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>against him. And he feared lest he deal him a blow with his stick then he'll instantly<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>die (for the king's son was quite a delicate person, and on account of his<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>delicacy he was very terrified, and thus it seemed to him). So he was walking<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>with the animals and the merchant (was) with them, and they came to a certain<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>spot; they took the sack wherein lies the herdsmen's bread, and he (the merchant)<br data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>gave them to eat; to him as well they gave of the bread, and he ate.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv><em data-astro-cid-qi76qrzv>Content continues in original source...</em></p> </div> </div> </section>

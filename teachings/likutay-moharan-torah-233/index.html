evil thoughts and ponderings overpower a person and he strengthens
and overpowers them and conquers them, there is to the Holy One
blessed be He great pleasure from this, and it is very precious in
the eyes of Hashem, blessed be He, like the parable that there is
with kings, sometimes on a festive day they place several animals to
fight (conquer) each other, and they stand and watch, and they have
great pleasure from the fight (conquest), similarly the thoughts,
they come from aspects of the animals (cha’yos, see Tikun 21 at its
end), and holy thoughts, they are aspects of pure animals, and evil
thoughts, they are aspects of impure animals, and from Above, they
place intentionally that they fight (conquer) each other, and there
is to the Holy One blessed be He great pleasure when the person
overpowers the impure animals and conquers them.</font></font></font></p>

<font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">The
general rule is, that it is impossible in any way in the world that
there be two thoughts together at one time, therefore one can easily
chase away evil thoughts by only remaining stationary (“sit and do
not do” – </font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><i>shev

that is, not to think that thought, only to think some other thought
in Torah or service or even business, because it is impossible that
there be two thoughts together in any way, and this is already
explained in another place (above in Torah-teaching 72), that one
does not need to make war and to shake their head here and there in
order to banish the evil thoughts because this does not help at all,
on the contrary by this they overpower more, only not to pay
attention to them at all, only to do one’s own thing - in what he
is occupied in Torah or prayer or business, and not to look behind
him at all, and by this it automatically departs.</font></font></font></p>

Who wants to taste taste of the hidden light that is secrets of the Torah that will be revealed for the future needs to raise attribute of the fear to its root.

And with what raise the fear? in aspect of judgment as written (Proverbs 29): "king in judgment establishes land" and land is aspect of fear as written (Psalms 76): "land feared" that is that judge all his businesses as written (there 112): "sustains his words in judgment" that is that judge and judge in himself all his businesses and in this removes from upon him all the fears and raises aspect of fear pure and clean and remains but fear of Hashem and not fear other because when no man judges and judges himself then judge and judge him above because if no judgment below there is judgment above (Devarim Rabba 5) and when judge the man in upper judgment then the judgment clothed in all the things and all the things made messengers to the Omnipresent to do in this the man judgment written as our sages, of blessed memory, said (Nedarim 41). "to Your judgments they stood", then "all Your servants" to do judgment in this the man but when judges himself and when there is judgment below no judgment above and no the fear clothed in any thing to arouse the man because he himself aroused and this (Psalms 50): "and places way" who places his ways (as our rabbis, of blessed memory, expounded Sotah 5:) that is that judges his ways as written (Exodus 21): "and these the judgments that you place" (see Genesis Rabba p 26 Mishpatim p 30) through this "I will show him in salvation of G-d" this aspect of fear as written (Ecclesiastes 12): "G-d fear" that is aspect of fear ascends from the klipah and from the nations through judgment because from beginning was clothed in the klipah and this that the man fears himself from some thing from minister or from thieves and rest fears this that the fear clothed in this the thing because if not was clothed the fear in this the thing not was power in this the thing to frighten the man.

And root of the fear is knowledge as written in Etz Chaim that mantzpak it in knowledge of small face as written (Proverbs 2): "then understand fear of Hashem and knowledge of G-d find" and main the knowledge is in the heart as written (Deuteronomy 29): "and not gave to you heart to know" also there main the fear as our sages z"l said (Kiddushin 32:): thing delivered to the heart, said in it: and fear from your G-d that is that know from whom fear that is to fear the glorious name fear of the exaltation (see below siman 154).

And when reaches to aspect of knowledge merits to perception of the Torah as written (Proverbs 8): "I wisdom dwelt cunning" that dwelling of the Torah by man of knowledge as written (Daniel 2): Kudsha Brich Hu gives wisdom to wise but there are two aspects Torah. there is aspect of revealed and aspect of hidden but to aspect of hidden no merits except for the future to come but in this world merits to aspect of hidden through prayer in self-sacrifice and to prayer merits through Torah that in revealed because the Torah which in revealed she aspect of Sinai as our sages, of blessed memory, said (Berachos 64:): Sinai and uprooter of mountains, which of them preferable? and answered: Sinai preferable, because all need to owner of wheat and the Torah that in revealed all need to it but the Torah that in hidden small they that need to it and aspect of Sinai is aspect of lowliness as our sages, of blessed memory, said (Sotah 5, ) that put aside the Holy One blessed be He all the mountains and not gave the Torah except on mount Sinai and our sages, of blessed memory, said (there 5:) that prayer of the low no despised as written (Psalms 51): "heart broken" etc and through prayer which in self-sacrifice that nullifies all his materiality and no boundary and when no boundary then can to perceive the Torah that for the future which she no boundary and no grasped in boundary.

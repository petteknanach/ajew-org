  <p>Likutay Moharan 7</p>
  <p>VeEleh HaMishpatim</p>
  <p>[In the language of our Rebbe, his memory for blessing] And these the judgments that you place before them (Exodus 21:1) Our sages, their memory for blessing, said: Woman was equated to man (Kiddushin 35a Bava Kama 15a) And it is in Mekhilta: Perhaps the students learn and do not understand Talmud says: "That you place before them" Arrange them before them like table arranged </p>
  <p>1. Know, that main the exile is only because of lack of emunah (faith) as it is written "Come, gaze from head of Amana" (Song of Songs 4:8) (see Tanchuma parashat Beshalach [10]) And emunah (faith) he aspect of tefillah (prayer) as it is written "And his hands faith" (Exodus 17:12), and its targum: spread in prayer And this aspect of miracles above nature because tefillah (prayer) above nature because the nature obligates so and the tefillah (prayer) changes the nature and this matter of miracle and for this needs emunah (faith) that he believe that there is Renewer and in His hand to renew thing as His will and main emunah (faith) aspect of tefillah (prayer) aspect of miracles is only in land of Israel as it is written "Dwell land and pasture faith" (Psalms 37:3) And there main ascents of the prayers as it is written "And this gate of heaven" (Genesis 28:17) (there 15) And for this when Avraham blemished in what shall I know and by this blemished in inheritance of land that she aspect of emunah (faith), aspect of tefillah (prayer) was exile of Egypt and specifically Jacob and his sons descended Egypt because they aspect of twelve versions of the tefillah (prayer) and lowered them in exile And Egypt he opposite the miracles as it is written "And Egypt flee to meet it" (Exodus 14:25) that there no place of the miracles and there no place of the tefillah (prayer) as it is written (there 9): "And it will be when I go out the city I will spread my palms" (Bereshit Rabbah 16:2) And all the exiles called by name Egypt on name that they cause anguish to Israel and when they blemish in emunah (faith), in tefillah (prayer), in land of Israel he descends to exile and this that our sages, their memory for blessing, said (Sanhedrin 97a) Messiah son of David not come, but until that perutah finished from the purse that is, that the epikorsim that no to them emunah (faith) in miracles and cover all the miracles in way of the nature because when that finished and emunah (faith) multiply in the world then will come Messiah because main the redemption dependent in this as it is written: "Come, gaze from head of Amana" </p>
  <p>2. But impossible to come to emunah (faith) except by truth as brought in the Zohar (Balak 198a): "And it will be righteousness girdle of his loins and faith" etc. (Isaiah 11:5) that is righteousness, that is emunah (faith) and they said there: emunah (faith) called, when connected in her truth </p>
  <p>3. And impossible to come to truth except by approaching to tzadikim and go in way of their advice and by that he receives from them their advice is engraved in him truth as it is written "Behold truth you desired" (Psalms 51:8) when you desire truth "In inward parts and in hidden wisdom you make me know" (Psalms 51:8) because the advices that he receives from them he aspect of marriage and coupling and when receiving advices from wicked he aspect of marriage in the klipah and this is "The serpent deceived me" (Genesis 3:13) language of marriage advices of the serpent that she received he aspect of marriage and by marriage injected in her impurity and at standing of Mount Sinai ceased their impurity (Shabbat 146a) because there they received 613 advices of holiness (Zohar Yitro 82a) and was to them marriage in holiness and why called advice in aspect of marriage ? because (Berakhot 61a) the kidneys advise and kidneys they instruments of the birth, instruments of the seed found, when receiving advice from man as if receiving from him seed and all according to man if wicked or tzadik and for this the Torah weakens power (Sanhedrin 26b) and called tushiyah because they 613 advices as it is written "To me advice and tushiyah" (Proverbs 8:14) and advices they in place of marriage aspect of coupling the weakening power and advice of the tzadik he all seed truth and this interpretation "And I planted you sorek" (Jeremiah 2:21) aspect of the redemption as it is written "I will whistle to them and gather them" (Zechariah 10:8) and by what ? by: "All seed truth" (there in Jeremiah) [completion of the verse "And I planted you" above] by advice of tzadikim come to truth and by this called emunah (faith), when connected in her truth and by this come the redemption as above because he receives drops of the intellect of the tzadik by advice that he receives from him and this: "Behold truth you desired in kidneys" in the kidneys "Wisdom you make me know" that I merit to receive drops of the brain, drops of the intellect by advice that I receive from them and then I merit to truth because the drops of the intellect called "all seed truth" </p>
  <p>4. And know, that by mitzvah of tzitzit the man is saved from advice of the serpent from marriage of wicked from aspect of licentiousness because tzitzit guard to licentiousness as brought in the Tikkunim (tikkun 18): "And took Shem and Yafet the garment and placed on shoulder of both" (Genesis 9:23) this aspect of tzitzit "And nakedness of their father not saw" (Genesis 9:23) because tzitzit covers on naked but Cham, that he evil inclination that heats body of man in transgression he cursed, as it is written (there): "Cursed Canaan" (Genesis 9:25) as it is written (there 3): "Cursed you from all the beast" (Genesis 3:14) and the garment that is tzitzit he guard from advice of the serpent from impurity of the serpent and this aspect of "Son porat on eye" (Genesis 49:22) because tzitzit language of "Peering from the cracks" (Song of Songs 2:9) by this merited to son porat that guarded from marriage of serpent from coupling of the other side and merited to coupling of holiness and this: "porat", language of coupling language of: "Be fruitful and multiply" (Genesis 1:28) and main the licentiousness dependent in the eyes as they said (Sotah 9a): Shimshon went after his eyes and as it is written "And not stray after your heart and after your eyes" (Numbers 15:39) and guard of tzitzit, that he aspect of eyes he guard from advice of the serpent and can to receive the advices from tzadik that he all seed truth </p>
  <p>5. And this interpretation: Said Rabba bar bar Chana: Said to me that Arab, come I will show you Mount Sinai. I went and saw that surround to it scorpions, and stand as white donkeys. And I heard bat kol that says: Woe to me that I swore, and now that I swore, who annuls for me Rashbam: "That I swore" from the exile, as written call good in prophets come and show you Mount Sinai that he aspect of advices because there received 613 advices I saw that surround to it scorpion that is that there advice of serpent advice of wicked that by them not can to receive advice of tzadikim, seed truth and stand as white donkeys this aspect of tzitzit that he guard from advice of the serpent, from licentiousness as our sages, their memory for blessing, said (Menachot 43b). Which punishment greater, that of white or that of tekhelet ? And they said: Parable to one, that commanded to bring him seal of gold, that is tekhelet, and seal of clay, that is white and this: "donkeys" language of clay and clay "white" that is white because now this main the tzitzit and I heard bat kol that says, woe to me that I swore interpreted Rabbi Shmuel: on the exile that is, by tzitzit can to come to advice of tzadikim to aspect of truth and by truth come to emunah (faith) as above and by emunah (faith) come the redemption as above and this that heard regret of the Name blessed be He on the exile because the tzitzit that they donkeys white caused all this and this interpretation: "And these" every place that said and these adds this aspect of Joseph aspect of guard of the bris aspect of tzitzit the judgments, this aspect of all seed truth as it is written "Judgments of Hashem truth" (Psalms 19:10) that merit to advice of tzadikim, to aspect of truth that you place before them this aspects when connected in her truth and this aspect of equated woman to man because this man and woman they aspect of connection truth and emunah (faith) and in this dependent the redemption as above and this: perhaps that will be the students learn and no understand Talmud says etc., arrange them before them like table arranged this aspect of the redemption of the future will be revealed all the wisdoms like table arranged as it is written "And full the land knowledge" (Isaiah 11:9) [until here language of our Rebbe, his memory for blessing] [omissions belonging to this Torah]. The tefillah (prayer) he aspect of emunah (faith), and he aspect of the miracles, because miracle above nature, and for this needs emunah (faith) as above, see there And for this, the tefillah (prayer) capable for memory because tefillah (prayer) he aspect of emunah (faith) as above and forgetfulness he matter that was before us thing what and forgotten and passed from us and she way of the conduct according to system of the constellations that conducted as order day after day and he opposite the emunah (faith) what that not so if believe that there is Renewer all in His will every day always and He enlivens and sustains all always and He above the time there no forgetfulness, and understand well And from now you will see wonders in words of our Rabbis, their memory for blessing (Shabbat 104a) mem and samekh that in the tablets in miracle were standing because mas he aspect of the forgetfulness and on this our Rabbis, their memory for blessing, said (Chagigah 9a) not similar the repeating his chapter hundred times to hundred times and one mas in gematria hundred and until hundred rules the prince of forgetfulness and this that sweetened Chazal: mem and samekh that is mas he aspect of the forgetfulness in miracle were standing because miracle he opposite the forgetfulness because miracles they aspect of the tefillah (prayer) aspect of emunah (faith) that she opposite the forgetfulness, as above And know etc. because tzitzit guard to licentiousness etc. on shoulder of both, this aspect of tzitzit etc. and this (Genesis 37:3): "Is not your brothers pasturing in Shechem" that is aspect of tzitzit as above that she guard to licentiousness and he aspect of guard of the bris that she aspect of Joseph therefore said Jacob to Joseph "Is not your brothers pasturing in Shechem" that he aspect yours "Come and I will send you to them" and this interpretation: "And I planted you sorek etc." because he receives drops of the intellect of the tzadik by advice that he receives from him and this sorek he aspect of shuruk that he three drops, as it is written in the Zohar (and in the Tikkunim, tikkun 56) and he three brains because he matter one because the drop comes from the brain and reaches to the kidneys that they instruments of the birth that cook the seed so the intellect born also in the brain and reaches until the kidneys the advising and three brains he aspect of (Isaiah 6). "Fatten heart etc. and his ears etc. and his eyes etc., lest he see with his eyes and with his ears hear and his heart understand and return etc." that is, that not want to attach himself to tzadikim lest he see etc. but when attaches himself to tzadikim and receives from them advice then he aspect of kidneys advising that they instruments of the birth that receives the drop from brain the divided to three drops three brains as above and then he see with his eyes and with his ears hear and his heart understand etc. that they aspect of the three brains and return and healed him and this is: "And I planted you sorek all seed truth", and understand and this interpretation: Said Rabba bar bar Chana etc. and this hinted also in opening of his words said to me that Arab and interpreted Rabbi Shmuel: in every place merchant Ishmaelite because Ishmaelite he aspect of the tefillah (prayer) as it is written "Because heard Hashem to your affliction" (Genesis 16:11) and its targum: because accepted Hashem your prayer and he aspect of emunah (faith) as above and this merchant, from language encircle encircle [aspect of encompassing] that he aspect of emunah (faith) as above, "And Your faith around You" (Psalms 89:9) and this is (Ruth 3:15): "And spread your wing on your maidservant" because tzitzit of holiness, that they wings of mitzvah he guard of the bris and he aspect of (there 48): "Behold your son Joseph comes to you" because all these the letters hint on the tzitzit that is number of the threads and the windings and the knots as explained in "Pri Etz Chayim" (in gate of the tzitzit, chapter 4, in the gloss, see there) [z"l the Pri Etz Chayim: 39 windings they 156 as number of Joseph. And 60 thumbs there in all the corners with the tzitzit as number of behold and as number of your son. Windings and knots and the threads they 32 and they twisted behold 64 as number of comes to you end quote]. and this is: "Behold your son Joseph comes to you" that is aspect of tzitzit as above by this "And Israel strengthened"</p>

For evil is opposition. For example, all that is against the will of
a person is evil. And in One, there is no opposition, but it is all
good. (Pesachim 50a): &quot;On that day, Hashem shall be One, etc.,&quot;
meaning that it shall be all good and beneficial. For in One, evil is
not applicable, and therefore in the future there will be a
fulfillment of &quot;The language of truth shall be established
forever&quot; (Proverbs 12:19). For then it shall all be one, all
good. For truth is one. For example, regarding a silver vessel, when
they say concerning it that it is a silver vessel, it is the truth.
But when they say concerning it that it is a gold vessel, it is
falsehood.&nbsp;</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><i>[Thus]</i></font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">,

etc.—that is the nullification of evil. And it is written (there):
&quot;And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard with
the kid,&quot; etc.—that is the aspect of nullification of
opposition. (There 25): &quot;And Hashem G-d shall wipe away tears
from all faces&quot;—that is the nullification of tears, which are
the aspect of falsehood, as mentioned above (see Tikun 22, folio
66b). For then, &quot;Hashem shall be One and His Name One,&quot;
which is all good, all truth, as mentioned above. And because of
this, in the future, impurity shall be nullified, as it is written

creation, or the spiritual world of creation], when the creation was
in potential, as it were, before He brought it out to action, it was
all one, and all truth, and all good, and all holy. Even the name
&quot;clean&quot; was not applicable to say, for &quot;clean&quot; is
only applicable when there is impurity, as it is written (Ezekiel
36): &quot;And you shall be clean from all your impurities.&quot; But
when all is one, there is no aspect of &quot;many calculations,&quot;
which is the main aspect of evil and impurity, as mentioned above.
For purity is the aspect of the median between the holy and the
impurity, through which impurity is rectified, as it is written: &quot;And
you shall be clean from all your impurities.&quot; And it is the
aspect of **choice** [</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><i>bechirah</i></font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">],

before the creation, for then it was all one, for in One there is no
choice, which is the aspect of purity. And when the Holy One, blessed
be He, brought creation out from potential to action, then the aspect
of purity immediately came into being. For when He brought out from
potential to action, there were two things, as it were: the aspect of
the One and the creation. And then choice is applicable, which is the
aspect of purity, which is a median between the One, for it is close
to Him and has not yet reached &quot;many calculations,&quot; which
is evil and impurity. However, it is an impression and sign of the
chain of emanation, that it can be emanated and reach until it
becomes evil and impurity. And therefore, it is written in the Zohar
(Beraishis, folio 48b) that the main grasping of impurity is from the
aspect of the **left** [</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><i>sitra

Aramaic for the left side, associated with judgment in Kabbalah]. For
purity indicates that there is impurity, and it is a sign that it
will emanate until it becomes impurity. And therefore, it is possible
to purify and to elevate impurity to purity, for it itself was
chained from purity, as it is written: &quot;And you shall be clean
from all your impurities.&quot;&nbsp;</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><i>[It

(see Zohar Korach 176b), the aspect of: &quot;And you shall purify
the sons of Levi&quot; (see Numbers 8). And Levi is the aspect of
left, as is known. And therefore, the main grasping of impurity is
from the aspect of left, for the left is the aspect of purity, from
where the main grasping of impurity, as mentioned above. And all
this—that is, the aspect of left, the aspect of purity, the aspect
of choice from where the main chaining of impurity, which is evil and
opposition, the aspect of falsehood, as mentioned above—is after
the creation, after creation came out from potential to action, where
then there were, as it were, two aspects, that is, the One and the
creation, as mentioned above.&nbsp;</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><i>[Thus]</i></font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">,

certainly, even in the ultimate end, not all will be equal. And since

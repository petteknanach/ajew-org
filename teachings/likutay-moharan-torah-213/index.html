that there is a name that when the Holy One blessed be He wants to
hide and cover the person from the accuser to save him from death
that was decreed on him, then He hides and covers him with this name,
and then the accuser wanders and searches around this person to seek
for him a place that he can enter under the hiding and the cover to
harm this person, but immediately when he gazes on him he departs and
has no strength because of this name. But know that when, G-d forbid,
he finds a place to enter under the hiding and the cover to rule over
the person, then on the contrary the accuser receives more strength
from this name, and this is aspects of what is written in the holy
Zohar (Pinchas 236) that Pinchas saw the mem of death wandering, that
is because the mem, it is aspects of the samech mem that wanders
around around as above. And know that the name above, it is Sal, and
it comes out from the verse&nbsp;</font></font></font><font color="#0000ff"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>&quot;You

above, and if, G-d forbid, he finds a place to rule then he receives
more strength from this name because the mem is joined to the name
Sal above and is made the combination of his name Samael, therefore
one needs to pause between the words You are a hiding place for me,
to the word from distress in order not to make the combination of his
name, G-d forbid, and then when he rules over the person, G-d forbid,
and receives more strength from this name as above then is made from
the name above the end of man to die (Berachos 17:): that it is
initial letters of the name Sal above but when they guard themselves
by the strength of the name above then the name above is a cover and
hiding aspects of You are a hiding place for me, and also from
distress You preserve me and guard me.</font></font></font></p>

      <p>Likutay Moharan 3</p>
      <p>Rabba bar bar Chana said: To me was seen that akrukta (frog), which was like the akra of Hagronya (city of Hagronya). And the akra of Hagronya how much is it? Sixty houses! Came a tannina (serpent) swallowed it. Came a pushkantza (female raven) and swallowed the tannina, and ascended sat in the tree. Come see how abundant is the strength of the tree! (Bava Batra 73a)</p>
      <p>Rashbam: Akrukta frog: like the akra of Hagronya large was like that city: and the akra of Hagronya how much is it? Sixty houses Talmud he says to it: came tannina Rabba he says to it: pushkantza female raven</p>
      <p>Behold, one who hears negina (melody/music) from a menagen (musician/player) who is wicked, it is difficult for him for the service of the Creator. And when he hears from a menagen (musician/player) who is kosher (fit/proper) and proper, then it is good for him as will be explained because behold, the voice of the negina (melody/music) is drawn from the birds as it is in the Midrash Why is the purification of a metzora (one afflicted with tzara'at - a spiritual skin disease) dependent on two living pure birds? Let the light-speaker come and atone for the light-speaker. Because he was stricken on account of his voice with which he spoke lashon hara (evil speech/slander). (Leviticus Rabbah 16:3). It is found that one who is kosher (fit/proper), his negina (melody/music) is drawn from the two living pure birds (Leviticus 14:4) that the aforesaid two birds, suck from the place where prophets suck. Therefore, the menagen (musician/player) is called chazan (cantor/singer) from the language of chazon (vision/prophecy), that is the language of prophecy because he takes the negina (melody/music) from the place where prophets suck. And when the menagen (musician/player) is wicked then he takes his negina (melody/music) from other birds that are in the klipah (husk/shell - forces of impurity). And it is written in the Zohar: Because the birds that are in the klipah (husk/shell - forces of impurity) suck from the breasts of the Malkhut (Kingship - a divine attribute). And when the night is divided, then a herald proclaims: As birds seized in the snare, so are sons of man ensnared (Ecclesiastes 9:12 - as per Zohar context) (Zohar Vayechi 217a; and see Etz Chaim Gate of Klipot chapter 2). And the tikkun (rectification/repair) is that he will be able to hear negina (melody/music) from every man it is by means of studying at night Torah sheba'al peh (Oral Torah) that is Gemara (Talmud) which is the aspect of night as it is in the Midrash When Moshe was on the mountain forty days and forty nights, he did not know when it was day and when night, only by this when he was learning Torah shebiksav (Written Torah) he knew it was day, and when he learned Torah sheba'al peh (Oral Torah) he knew it was night. (Midrash Tehillim 19:2). It is found, that Torah sheba'al peh (Oral Torah) is the aspect of night. And like that which our Rabbis of blessed memory said In darkness He has set me this is Talmud Bavli (Sanhedrin 24a). And this is And to darkness He called night (Genesis 1:5) that is by means of studying Sh(isha - six) S(edarim - orders) (Six Orders - referring to the six sections of the Mishnah/Talmud) he will repair the six rings in the kaneh (root: Q-N-H - reed/cane) (windpipe), from them goes out the voice. And this is Arise cry out in the night (Lamentations 2:19) that is that there be arising to the ron (singing/joyous cry) that is by means of the night which is Gemara Sh(isha - six) S(edarim - orders) (Six Orders - referring to the six sections of the Mishnah/Talmud). However when he studies not for its sake (lishma - for the sake of Heaven), that is for the sake of being called Rabbi the learning is not in such importance and when studies in the night a thread of kindness is drawn on him (Chagigah 12b) and shields on him that will not damage him the aforesaid thought. And there is in the writings of the Ari z"l because birds in klipah (husk/shell - forces of impurity) they are brains in Malkhut (Kingship) diklipah (of impurity) and the two living pure birds, they are the building of Malkhut (Kingship) dikedusha (of holiness) therefore David praised himself before Shaul And skilled in playing (1 Samuel 16:18) because the negina (melody/music) is the building of the Malkhut (Kingship) therefore worthy is he for Malkhut (kingship) and this that is written by him From behind nursing ewes He has brought him (Psalms 78:71) that is from after the suckling ones, that is Netzach (Eternity) and Hod (Splendor - divine attributes) because they suckle the prophets and they are building of the Malkhut (Kingship). And this that Rabba bar bar Chana said: To me was seen that akrukta (frog). And Rashbam interpreted: frog, that is bird of knowledge (see Tikunei Zohar tikkun 7 and see in Kavvanot of Ari z"l on matter of blood frog) which was like akra d'Hagronya (city of Hagronya) from language Cry in the throat (Isaiah 58:1) that is that the negina (melody/music) is drawn from him. And akra d'Hagronya how much is it? Sixty houses. That is by what will you repair the aspect of cry in throat? By sixty houses, that is by sixty tractates. And Rashbam interpreted: Talmud he says to it, that is that he study Talmud came tannina (serpent) swallowed her and Rash interpreted: rabba (great one - play on "rabbi") he says to it that is by that he studies not for its sake (lishma), will swallow her the serpent and this that Rashbam interpreted, rabba he says to it that is by that he will study for the sake of being called rabbi came pushkantza (female raven) and Rashbam interpreted: raven that is by that he studies in the night, from language aravit (evening) (see Rashi Eruvin 22a s.v. mashkim u'ma'ariv) and swallowed her that is and shields on him from the serpent mentioned above and ascended sat in the tree interpreted the Maharsha, that he is aspect of Avraham that is written by him And planted eshel (Genesis 21:33) that is aspect of chesed (kindness) that is the thread of chesed (kindness) that is drawn on him shields on him from the aforesaid serpent come see how abundant strength of the tree that is that rabba astonishes himself that so much His chesed (kindness) has overpowered us, that even on this can shield and by this will be settled the adjacency of the Mishnah (Avot chapter 1). Make yourself a rav (master/teacher) and acquire yourself a chaver (friend/companion) and be judging every man to scale of merit because by that hears the negina (melody/music) as above he repairs building of his Malkhut (kingship) and this make yourself a rav (master), that is that repair aspect of Malkhut (kingship) and this by acquire yourself a chaver (friend) that is by kaneh (root: Q-N-H) (cane), that the voice goes out from him that connects the two keruvim (cherubim) to be faces in faces As work of a man and his connections (1 Kings 7:36) in time that Yisrael do will of the Place (G-d) (see Bava Batra 99a and Rashbam there). And then when he repairs aspect of his Malkhut (kingship) and he can to rule in all that he desires and he can to put to death this one and to give life to this one and found world destroyed for this one said: and be judging every man to scale of merit that needs to judge every man to scale of merit because the Holy Blessed One does not desire in destruction of the world For not for tohu (chaos) He created her, to dwell He formed her (Isaiah 45:18) and for this a saying in mouth of people now to say that the chazanim (cantors) they are fools, and not possessors of knowledge because now Malkhut (kingship) dikedusha (of holiness) in exile and therefore the negina (melody/music) which is drawn from place of prophets from aspect of brains and knowledge of Malkhut (kingship) dikedusha (of holiness) and now that the Malkhut (kingship) in exile, and therefore the negina (melody/music) is blemished and therefore the chazanim (cantors) they are without knowledge because they have no strength now to draw the negina (melody/music) from her root in kedusha (holiness) which is aspect of brains and knowledge of Malkhut (kingship) dikedusha (of holiness), as above but in the future that Malkhut (kingship) dikedusha (of holiness) will be elevated and will be Hashem for king on all the earth (Zechariah 14:9) then the negina (melody/music) will be elevated and completed in aspect of knowledge of Malkhut (kingship) dikedusha (of holiness) from there the negina (melody/music) is drawn as above and this For king all the earth G-d, sing maskil (with understanding) (Psalms 47:8) because then when will be Hashem for king on all the earth and Malkhut (kingship) dikedusha (of holiness) will be elevated then: sing maskil (with understanding), that is that the chazanim (cantors) the singers will be with knowledge and intellect by that Malkhut (kingship) dikedusha (of holiness) will be elevated and receive the negina (melody/music) from her root in kedusha (holiness) which is aspect of knowledge and brains of Malkhut (kingship) dikedusha (of holiness) as above [pertains to above] (see Pesachim 50a and see Zohar Vayechi 219a) For great above heavens Your chesed (kindness) (Psalms 108:5) heavens is aspect of voice, as written From heavens You caused Your voice to be heard (Psalms 76:9) because by the chesed (kindness) that is aspect of thread of chesed (kindness), drawn by that studies Torah in the night by this the voice is repaired as above and this: for great above heavens Your chesed (kindness) as above the two birds dikedusha (of holiness), that from there the prophecy is drawn, they are building Malkhut (kingship) dikedusha (of holiness) and therefore the setting up of king was by prophecy as all kingdom house of David that was by prophecy and the prophecy is drawn from the keruvim (cherubim) that they are aspect of two birds aforesaid that they are building Malkhut (kingship) dikedusha (of holiness) as above from after nursing ewes brought him, that is from after the suckling ones because they suckle to the prophets etc as above and this from after nursing ewes that is that David the king peace upon him was able to repair and to elevate also the negina (melody/music) that is not from kosher (fit/proper) man to elevate her to the kedusha (holiness) and this: from after nursing ewes brought him that is also the negina (melody/music), that she is from behind the kedusha (holiness) in aspect from after nursing, from after the suckling ones because the negina (melody/music) dikedusha (of holiness) he is from place that prophets suck and the negina (melody/music) that not in kedusha (holiness) she is aspect from after nursing, from behind the kedusha (holiness) and David the king peace upon him was able to repair this negina (melody/music) also and by this Malkhut (kingship) dikedusha (of holiness) was elevated as above and this: from after nursing ewes brought him to shepherd in Jacob etc because by this merited to Malkhut (kingship) as above.</p>

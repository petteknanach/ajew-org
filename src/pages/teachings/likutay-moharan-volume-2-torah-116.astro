        When a person wishes to do teshuvah [repentance], he should have a broken heart. For the broken heart is the vessel for receiving the divine flow. As it is written: "A broken and contrite heart, Hashem, You will not despise" (Psalms 51:19). And our Sages, of blessed memory, said that Hashem, blessed is He, dwells in the heart that is broken and contrite. For when a person's heart is broken over his sins, Hashem, blessed is He, draws near to him and helps him to return. And this is the aspect of the teshuvah of David HaMelech [King David], who said: "My heart is broken within me" (Psalms 109:22). And through his broken heart, he merited to have his teshuvah accepted.
      </p>

      <p>
        And this is also the aspect of the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai, where the Jewish people stood with broken hearts, as it is written: "And they stood at the bottom of the mountain" (Exodus 19:17), and our Sages, of blessed memory, said that it was as if the mountain was hanging over their heads like a barrel. And through their broken hearts, they merited to receive the Torah. And this is the aspect of the broken tablets, which represented the broken hearts of the Jewish people.
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore, when a person wishes to do teshuvah, he should first break his heart over his sins. For the broken heart is the vessel for receiving the divine flow. And through the broken heart, one merits to have his teshuvah accepted and to return to Hashem with a full heart. And this is the aspect of the redemption, for when the Jewish people do teshuvah with broken hearts, the redemption will come. For the broken heart is the key to the redemption, as it is written: "Return to Me with all your heart" (Joel 2:12).

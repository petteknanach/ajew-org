FREEDOM - LIBERTY - EMANCIPATION Sunday, July 20, 2025 Likutay Moharan - Torah-teaching 8 Likutay Moharan 8 8 - I Saw a Golden Menorah I saw, and behold, a menorah ( menorah [lampstand]) all of gold, with its bowl on top of it, etc. (Zechariah 4, Haftarah for Shabbat Chanukah) 1. Behold, precious is the groaning and moaning [which they call krechtz ] from a Jewish person, because it is the completion of the deficiencies. For by means of the aspect of the breathing that is the spirit ( ruach [wind, breath]) of life the world was created, as it is written "And with the spirit of His mouth all their host." (Psalms 33:6) And the renewal of the world will be also in the aspect of the spirit , as it is written "You will send Your spirit they will be created and You will renew the face of the ground." (Psalms 104:30) And it is also the vitality of man, for the vitality of the man is the breathing , as it is written "And He blew in his nostrils the soul of life." (Genesis 2:7) And it is written "All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life." (Genesis 7:22) And as the sages said: if the breathing is lacking the life is lacking. It is found, that the main vitality of all the things is in the aspect of spirit . And when there is deficiency in some thing the main deficiency is in the aspect of the vitality of that thing that is the aspect of the spirit of life of that thing, for the spirit is the sustainer of the thing. And the sigh is the lengthening ( root א.ר.כ) of the breathing and it is in the aspect of "long of nostrils" ( erekh apayim [long-suffering]) that is he lengthens his spirit and therefore when he sighs on the deficiency and lengthens his spirit he draws the spirit of life to the deficiency because the main deficiency is the removal of the spirit of life as above and therefore by means of the sigh he completes the deficiency. 2. But from where do they receive the spirit ( ruach [wind, breath]) of life? Know, that the main spirit of life they receive from the tzadik ( tzadik [righteous one]) and the rav ( rav [master, teacher]) of the generation because the main spirit of life is in the Torah ( Torah [teaching, law]), as it is written "And the spirit of G-d hovering on the face of the waters" (Genesis 1:2) it is the Torah and the tzadikim ( tzadikim [righteous ones]) are attached to the Torah and therefore the main spirit of life is with them and when he is connected to the tzadik and the rav of the generation when he sighs and lengthens ( root א.ר.כ) his spirit he draws the spirit of life from the tzadik of the generation that is attached in the Torah where the spirit is and this is what the tzadik is called "A man in whom there is spirit" (Numbers 27:18) that he knows to walk against the spirit of each and every one (as Rashi interpreted there) because the tzadik draws and completes the spirit of life of each and every one as above and this is the aspect of the north wind that blows on David's harp (Berakhot 3b) because David's harp was of five strings against the five books of Torah and the north wind that was blowing in it is the aspect of "And the spirit of G-d hovering on the face of the waters" the above because the north wind is the aspect of the spirit hidden in the heart of man (see Tikkun 69) that is the aspect of the spirit of life because north is lacking (Bava Batra 25b) and the deficiency is in the heart as it is written "And He will give you the requests of your heart" (Psalms 37:4) "G-d will fulfill all your requests" (Psalms 20:5) and the main spirit of life is in the heart and as it is written in Tikkunei Zohar (Tikkun 13): all of them are conducted after the heart like a king etc., as you said "To where the spirit was to go" (Ezekiel 1:20) etc. because the spirit is in the heart and the deficiency is the removal of the spirit whose place is in the heart and therefore the deficiency is felt in the heart and therefore when the deficiency is filled that is the aspect of the spirit as above it is said: "And He will give you the requests of your heart, G-d will fulfill" etc., that is as above and therefore Israel that receive the spirit of life from the Torah are called by the name north as it is written "Against Your people they plot craftily and conspire against Your hidden ones." (Psalms 83:4) 3. But the wicked who speak against the tzadik ( tzadik [righteous one]) harshly with pride and contempt from where do they receive the spirit to complete the deficiency? But know that there is a rav ( rav [master]) of the klipah ( klipah [husk, shell]) and he is the aspect of Esav as it is written about Esav "I have much" (Genesis 33:9) and he is the aspect of "The chiefs of Esav" (Genesis 36:15) and as Onkelos translated: "The great ones of Esav" the aspect of the rav of the klipah and from them the wicked receive the spirit and it is the aspect of the spirit of impurity the aspect of storm wind as it is written "Behold Esav my brother is a hairy man" (Genesis 27:11) (see Tikkun 69) and therefore their spirit is great and strong for the moment like a storm wind that is great at its time and therefore "All his adversaries blow at them" (Psalms 10:5) "blow" precisely that he overpowers them by means of the aspect of the spirit of his mouth that is great at its time but it has no endurance at all and in the end it perishes and is lost and storms his body and his soul (see Tikkun 18) and as it is written "And pays His haters to their face to destroy him" (Deuteronomy 7:10) and pays language of completion of the deficiency that is drawn to him that is the aspect of lengthening ( root א.ר.כ) of the spirit and this is to their face because their face is the aspect of the spirit as it is written "The show of their countenance does witness against them" (Isaiah 3:9) this is the nose (Yevamot 120a) that is the aspect of the spirit as it is written: "And He blew in his nostrils the soul of life" "All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life" but it is to destroy him because even though it is great for the moment in the end it is lost as above and this is the aspect of long-suffering to the wicked (Yerushalmi Ta'anit chapter 2 halakhah 1) (and see Eruvin 22a) because the spirit the breathing is in the aspect of long-suffering and that is he lengthens his nostril and collects to himself (Bereishit Rabbah 80:67) because even though for the moment the spirit is great and strong the aspect of he lengthens his nostril but in the end he collects to himself as above and therefore Israel are called "Afflicted storm-tossed" (Isaiah 54:11) because they are now under the rule of Esav the hairy man the aspect of storm wind the above but the one attached to tzadikim receives the spirit of life, completion of the deficiency from the tzadik and the rav of holiness. 4. And therefore "And a wise man will atone for it" (Proverbs 16:14) because the deficiency is due to sins as our sages said of blessed memory there is no death without sin and no suffering without iniquity (Shabbat 55b) as it is written "And I will visit with a rod their transgression and with plagues their iniquity" (Psalms 89:33) and therefore the tzadik who draws the spirit of life and completes the deficiency atones for the iniquity and he is a tower of mercy and grace from the Creator blessed be His name who contracted Himself to have the spirit of life with the tzadikim that is that they receive the spirit of life from the Torah and they draw the spirit of life to the deficiencies and by this they atone for the iniquiti</p>

Who can tell over, who can fathom, all the great, and<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>wondrous, and awesome things done by our master, our teacher, and our<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>rabbi, light of lights, pure, pristine light, the cached, and hidden,<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>and concealed light, with the collective entirety of the souls of<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>Israel, upon whom (/which) are contingent all the worlds. And<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>especially that which he accomplished and did with his men close to<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>him who merited to revel in the holy shade of his shadow, and to hear<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>from his mouth what they heard, matters which Atteek Yoamin<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>(-Ancient of Days – a Supernal Divine Countenance – Daniel 7:9)<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>concealed (Pesachim 119a). And particularly, that which he worked and<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>did with my poor and destitute self, that he erected me from the dust<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>and the dumps, and sat me down next to him, and with his mercy drew<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>me even more, close to him, and placed his hand on me (-approbation,<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>ordination) to receive and to write all his words of Torah, and his<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>discourses, and his legendary tales. All and everything he merited me<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>that it should be written by my hand, and he said explicitly (Chuchma<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>and Beena article 21, and this is a seeming resolution to the query<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>in Yisroel Saba chapter “Above Nature,” that “a little” goes<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>on Rabbi Nussun as well as Rabbi Naftoli) that there is no one that<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>knows from him, except for I (-Rabbi Nussun), a little, and many<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>additional such expressions.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-curjtplb>And<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>in truth, my soul knows very well what is impossible to tell over<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>whatsoever, and I already wrote a lot, and I told over orally to my<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>friends and my students a very great deal, and thank G-d my words<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>made an impact, with his great power, that the truth entered their<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>hearts like burning fire, and they were aroused plentifully to Hashem<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>Yisburach. And many already went on in holiness and purity and passed<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>away with a good name, from the midst of words of Torah, and prayer,<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>and perfect faith, “their portion is in life (Psalms 17:14),” and<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>those who remain for length of days and years, behold they are<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>strong, with the help of Hashem Yisburach, with the truth and the<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>faith, like a molten mirror (Job 37:17), so that they never slip<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>(Proverbs 10:30).</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-curjtplb>Even<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>still, I know in my soul, that they, also they, need very much my<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>information (Shabbos 55b), and they still don't know the light of the<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>truth of the truth to its truth, completely, properly, as it is<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>implanted in my soul. And similar to the homily of our Rabbis o.b.m.<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>(Sanhedrin 68a), a great deal I learned from my rabbis, and I didn't<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>release from them, just, as a dog which laps from the ocean, and my<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>students didn't withdraw from me etc.. What can I say? For all these<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>words of mine involve the knowledge of the pleasant hisnoatzitzus<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>(-sparkling) of G-dliness in the heart, which is for each one<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>according to what his heart fathoms (Zohar, Beraishis 103b), and<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>these themselves are manifestations of his might, these themselves<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>are manifestations of his awesomeness (Yuma 69b), which he exerted<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>and toiled in His service Blessed He so much until he merited to what<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>he merited, and ascended to the place he ascended, (from) which he<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>drew such deep intellect, deep water advice in the heart of a man<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>(Proverbs 20:5), deep, deep who can find it (Ecclesiastes 7:24), to<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>the extent that with his supreme wisdom and his mighty strength he<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>illuminated with his goodness in the heart of (even) the lowest and<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>degenerate hisnoatzitzus (-sparkling) of conception of the<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>Divine, what is absolutely impossible to relate to a friend. And see<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>that this is a novelty which never was ever, and like it is alluded<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>in the torah (-holy teaching) of “A field of knives” (Likutay<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>Moharan 30), see there, that there is a need for a great rabbi, and<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>wondrous craftsman, and loyal doctor, that can impart conception of<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>the Divine in the heart of such small, such sick, such alienated<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>people.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-curjtplb>And<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>behold, if literary means and verbal means are insufficient to tell<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>over a thousandth of what is in my heart, even still it is impossible<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>to release nothing, therefore from the day that I merited to draw<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>close, Hashem Yisburach and he encouraged me to engage in writing the<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>awesome revelation of his holy Torah, and Hashem Yisburach<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>strengthened me to always write the matters and conversation that<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>were by each Torah, because I knew that every single word is a<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>complete Torah. However in the beginning I was not yet careful to<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>write all the holy conversations and holy words that left his holy<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>mouth, just those that had pursuance of words of Torah, or were<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>related to some Torah (-holy teaching).</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-curjtplb>Until<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>after a few years of my drawing close to him, Hashem roused my heart<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>to begin to also inscribe some of the words and matters that were<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>heard from his holy mouth then, and little of what was already heard.<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>Also I inscribed some stories and matters of what transpired to him<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>and his men, and a little of the stories of his exertion and toils<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>which he toiled and exerted in the service of Hashem, through which<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>he merited to what he merited, and the order of his journey to the<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>Land of Israel, and some stories and events that took place by each<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>and every Torah and by each Legendary Tale, and how, and through what<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>his mercy was invoked until he opened his holy mouth and revealed<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>what he revealed.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-curjtplb>And<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>even though with all of these it is impossible to explain and<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>illustrate well in writing the nature of the matter as it was when it<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>took place, even still I did not abstain from writing and inscribing<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>all that is possible to inscribe, and one who has acute intelligence<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>will understand from his own intellect a little of the nature of the<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>matter, all this and perhaps the future generations will merit to<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>know all the fantastic and wondrous feats which were done for us by<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>the Master of All, Who conducts every generation with His kindness,<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>the schemes of His heart (stand) for generation and generation<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>(Psalms 33:11), Who does novelties all the time, so that His name<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>will be proclaimed in all the land, so that they will rouse in every<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>generation to return to Him Blessed He, for He already cleared a<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>correct way before us by his hand o.b.m., so that from now on whoever<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>desires to approach the holy, can easily draw close to Him blessed<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>He, by the ways explained in his holy books. Fortunate is one who<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>adheres to them, “till in them, till in them, age and wear out in<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>them, and do not budge from them, for there is no measure better than<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>them (Ethics of Our Fathers 5:22).”</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-curjtplb>Behold<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>all this my eye saw (Job 13:1, 33:29), that it is His will blessed He<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>to inscribe everything in a book, therefore it has been some time now<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>that I took it to my heart to write and inscribe every conversation,<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>and word, and matter, and story that rises in my memory, and these<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>are the very things written in this book. And I called the name of<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>this composition by the name “Life of &lt;Cha'yay&gt; Moa.Ha.Ra.N.<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>[-acronym: &lt;Moarainoo&gt; Our Teacher/Guide &lt;virabbainu&gt;<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>and Leader/Rabbi, Rabbi Nachman], since most of it speaks of his holy<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>life, of what transpired over him in the holy days of his life, and<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>the life which he lived in the world. For he was a truly live man who<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>had no counterpart, and he constantly lived true life, and every time<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>he lived new life, as was heard from his holy mouth, that one time he<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>exclaimed, “I lived today life, such life which I have never<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>lived,” and then he began to reveal a little outline of the torah<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>(Likutay Moharan 18) “Kartulleesuh – A Chest,” as is<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>noted in this book, further on in its place (article 8). And<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>similarly a few times I heard from him o.b.m. wondrous glorification<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>regarding his life, and regarding the degradation of the life of the<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>world who don't consider their tachlis (-ultimate purpose),<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>and also with the life of the world there are innumerable variations,<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>as is explained a little, further on.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-curjtplb>The<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>general principle is, that the essential life is the true life which<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>is true wisdom, as it is written (Ecclesiastes 7), “Wisdom give<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>life to its possessor.” And the main wisdom is to strive and toil<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>to know and recognize Him Blessed He, for He is life of life (chay<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>hachayim). And everyone, according to his proximity to this, so<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>is his life life, and vice versa. And therefore (Brachos 18b) evil<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>people (even) in their lifetime are called (-considered) dead, and<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>vice versa, tzaddikim (even) in their death are called (-considered)<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>alive, for they are always bound in true life, as it is written<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>(Deuteronomy 4), “And you (plural) who are clinging to Hashem your<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>G-d, you are all alive today.” And it is for this life that we pray<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>copiously on Rosh Hashana (-Jewish New Years) and Yom Kippur,<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>“remember us for life,” “and inscribe for life,” because<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>aside from this, everything is vain, and there is no life whatsoever.<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>And regarding this life it says (Deuteronomy 5), “so that you<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>live,” (Deuteronomy 8), “so that your days are plentiful etc.,”<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>(Deuteronomy 5:30), “so that you live.” &#123;censored: However life<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>such as merited by him o.b.m., have still not been experienced by any<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>person in the world&#125;. Fortunate is he who merits to feel a little of<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>the sparkling (hisnoatzitzus) of the pleasantness of his life<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>which he lived, long life, truly good life, as is understood from the<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>story (-Rabbi Nachman's stories, published under the title: Legendary<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>Tales, story 13) of the Seven Beggars, which regarding this life,<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>King David r.i.p. beseeched (Psams 16), “Give me to know the way of<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>life etc..”</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-curjtplb>In<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>this book are written all the stories that we heard from his holy<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>mouth, also some of the conversation and narrative that we heard from<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>his holy mouth, because his words are entirely Torah. Also some<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>incidents that happened and transpired between him and his adherents.<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>And from all of them the intellectual will understand his utter<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>greatness and amplitude of his extremely phenomenal holiness, what<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>the mouth cannot speak nor the heart reckon, and the intellectual at<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>this time will be quiet and silent, and everyone according to what<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>their heart fathoms, will understand an infinitesimal bit, less than<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>a drop of the ocean. And even what we heard and saw, we did not<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>present here, just a tiny bit alludingly. And because of the utter<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>strife that they fought (/multiplied) ardently against him, we are<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>forced to put a restraint to our mouths, so as not to relate his<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>praise. And the utter magnitude of his holiness and loftiness is very<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>loftier and superior than our intellect.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-curjtplb>However,<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>even this minute fragment that we merited to know and understand a<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>little, is impossible to tell over completely because of the great<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>strife, even though it would be beneficial for the world, I just<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>inscribed this for the future generations, and for the coming days<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>which are approaching peacefully, so that it should not be forgotten<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>from our mouths and the mouths of our progeny. In order that the<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>future generations know how greatly cherished (the Nation of) Israel<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>is before Hashem Yisburach, that they merited in the last generations<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>to such lucid and pure light, the light that is cached (ohr<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>haganuz) and hidden. Fortunate is the eye that saw him, fortunate<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>is the ear that heard from his mouth his holy words. And one who<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>studies his holy books in depth will have a slight understanding of<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>his utter holiness.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-curjtplb>The<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>words of the writer, the small Nussun son of my master, my father,<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>our teacher Rav Naftoli Hertz y.t.v. (-may his Bastion protect him<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>and give him life) of Nemorov.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-curjtplb>And<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>I request of the reader not to be astonished if he finds sometimes in<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>our words some conversations and stories of Rabbainu o.b.m. that are<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>written here which appear to be simple things, and sometimes they<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>seemingly have no explanation whatsoever, and it will be difficult in<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>his eyes, for what (purpose) were they written. However, in reality,<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>in all the words, and conversations, and stories that are written<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>here, there are inherent matters behind all of them, and whoever<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>merited to stand before him and hear from his mouth the matters and<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>the conversations, it would misnoatzaitz (-glimmer) for him a<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>little, and he would see and understand a little that they are very<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>supernal and lofty, and he would be aroused to Hashem Yisburach by<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>each and every word that left his mouth with wondrous holiness and<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>purity. And because of this I wasn't able to hold back from writing<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>and jotting down a few stories and words for a remembrance, and even<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>though there are in them a few words that the reader will not<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>understand the gist of them, even still (Yevumos 30a regarding a<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>mishna that is seemingly redundant) the mishna does not move from<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>it's place.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-curjtplb>And<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>whoever desires the truth can find in most of the words, wondrous<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>matters, and many, many wondrous awakenings for the service of Hashem<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>Yisburach, and many aitzoas (-directives, advice, remedies),<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>and much succor, which will strengthen a person immensely not to<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>despair of himself in any way, and so forth, because (Deuteronomy<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>32), “It is not a vain matter for you,” and if it is vain, (that<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>is only) from you (Jerusalem Talmud Peah), for even the simple words<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>of Rabbainu o.b.m., the great and the holy, they introduce great<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>light, and they have great power to arouse the whole world to His<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>service blessed He, which was the concern Rabbainu o.b.m. was<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>entirely preoccupied with all the days of his holy life. It was also<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>heard from his holy mouth, that even his simple words need to be<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>written, because in each and every statement of his, there are (in<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>them) extremely deep intentions, and they are great generalizations<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>(-principles that incorporate all, and are all encompassing), and<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>every person can extract from them wondrous aitzoas (-advice,<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>remedies) and upright practices for His service blessed His name.</p> <p class="teach-content" data-astro-cid-curjtplb>[The<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>transcriber says, regarding the hiddenness of the great and wondrous<br data-astro-cid-curjtplb>light of the Ad.m.ur.

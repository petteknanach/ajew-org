        The bread of shame is the aspect of eating bread with a curse, and the aspect of being ashamed to eat the bread. And this is what we say in the Haggadah: "Let all who are hungry come and eat" (see Haggadah shel Pesach), that we invite all who are hungry to come and eat from our matzah. For in the aspect of bread of shame, one is ashamed to eat, for he feels that he has not earned this food through his own toil. Therefore, we invite all who are hungry to come and eat, to remove the aspect of shame. For when many eat together, the shame is shared among them, and it is not so great. And this is the aspect of: "The one who has a zabach [sacrifice] will slaughter it" (Zevachim 5a), but this is a different matter. For the bread of shame is when one receives charity, he is ashamed to take it. Therefore, we make a seudah [meal] with many people, so that the shame will be lessened. And this is also the aspect of the Pesach sacrifice, which is eaten with many people, as it is written: "No uncircumcised person shall eat thereof" (Exodus 12:48). For through being together, the shame is removed.

        And this is also the aspect of the matzah, which is called "lechem oni" [bread of poverty], as it is written: "And they baked unleavened cakes, for it did not leaven, for they were driven out of Egypt" (Exodus 12:39). And the matzah is called "lechem oni" because it is the bread of poverty, and there is no shame in eating it, for it is the bread that they ate in their poverty. And through eating matzah, one merits to remember the exodus from Egypt, and through that, he merits to be saved from all shame and all disgrace. For the exodus from Egypt was the redemption from shame, as it is written: "And also that nation, to whom they are subject, I will judge, and afterward they will go out with great wealth" (Genesis 15:14). For they were redeemed from the shame of the Egyptians. And this is the aspect of the bread of shame being removed through the matzah.

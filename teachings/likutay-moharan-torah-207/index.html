145] and as it is written in the writings that the five gevuros in
the daas (knowledge) burst forth and go out in the mouth and are made
from them the five outlets of the mouth. It is found that all the
speeches are aspects of gevuros and one needs to sweeten them, and
the sweetening is by study of the Torah and good speeches that they
speak, by this they sweeten the speeches that are aspects of the
gevuros. And know that sometimes hard gevuros go out, may the
Merciful save us, and they come in this world to the great ones of
the generation because of that they have great daas, therefore when
hard gevuros go out, G-d forbid, they come in the daas of the great
ones and there they burst forth and go out from the mouth, and are
made from them speeches as above, and then the speeches are aspects
of hard gevuros and one needs to see to sweeten them. And when they
do not sweeten the hard gevuros, G-d forbid, because of that they do
not have strength to sweeten them or that they are then in a small
level that it is impossible to sweeten them because of that they
damaged then in some damage and sin, because even tzadikim and great
ones sometimes they damage and err in some thing,&nbsp;</font></font></font><font color="#0000ff"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>&quot;For
there is no tzadik on earth&quot;</b></font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;etc.
[Ecclesiastes 7] and because of that they are then in this aspect
they do not sweeten the hard gevuros that they are the speeches, and
then when they are then in this aspect they do not sweeten the hard
gevuros that they are the speeches, and then when they do not sweeten
the speeches that they are hard gevuros, then they begin to speak
with those speeches evil speeches on the general or on the
particular, or that they speak on the tzadik of the generation, and
then all their speeches that they are hard gevuros come and fall on
the tzadik of the generation, G-d forbid, and the tzadik of the
generation needs to see to sweeten those hard gevuros that they are
the speeches above, and by that he judges them favorably in that they
speak on him, it is found that he inclines toward chesed (kindness)
and by this sweetens them, or by that he receives the sufferings that
they speak on him, receives them with love, by this he sweetens also
their speeches that they are the hard gevuros as above. But if there
is no strength, G-d forbid, in the tzadik of the generation to
sweeten them, then he can fall from his level very much, G-d forbid,
by those gevuros above that come on him, or that he departs, G-d
forbid, by this, and then by his departure his soul sweetens those
hard gevuros above, and from this was the departure of the Baal Shem
Tov because he said that he would depart from the deed of the shatz
(Shabbatai Tzvi) may his name be erased, because with the shatz may
his name be erased there were several great ones of the generation
and outstanding scholars that he misled them as is famous, and they
went out from the general and spoke evils on the Torah shebe'al peh
(Oral Torah), and this was because of that hard gevuros came to them
and they did not sweeten them because of the aspect above, and
therefore they spoke evil speeches on the general, and those speeches
fell on the great of the generation, and the Baal Shem Tov, his
memory for blessing, he was then the great of the generation, and
from this he departed, and as they say in the name of the Baal Shem
Tov, his memory for blessing, that he said that two holes were made
to him in his heart by the deed of the shatz may his name be erased,
because when they speak on the Torah shebe'al peh or when they speak
on the tzadik of the generation himself it is one thing literally,
because the main Torah shebe'al peh is dependent on the tzadik of the
generation as it is written in the Zohar (Vayeitzei 153:): The
Shechinah sits between two tzadikim, which is the Torah shebe'al peh
as brought in another place [see in the Torah &quot;Tehilah LeDavid&quot;
sign 12] and similarly the Talmud Chacham is himself the Torah as our
Rabbis, their memory for blessing, said (Makkot 22:): How foolish
etc. that stand before the Torah etc. But when the tzadik sweetens
their speeches then he returns and makes from the speeches Torah as
brought in another place [there sign 12] and then he makes Torah of
chesed, that is to teach to others as our Rabbis, their memory for
blessing, said (Sukkah 49:) on the verse&nbsp;</font></font></font><font color="#0000ff"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="5" style="font-size: 18pt"><b>&quot;And
Torah of chesed on her tongue&quot;</b></font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;[Proverbs
31] this is who learns in order to teach it, because certainly when
they make Torah from those speeches it is possible for him to teach
others with it, and it is found that it is Torah of chesed and by
this sweetens them.</font></font></font></p>

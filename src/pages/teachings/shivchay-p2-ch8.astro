      <p>And on the 18th of Eyar (Lag BuOmer, Friday, 4 May, 1798) he embarked from his house, from the holy community of Medvedivkuh to the city Nicoalayev, and there was a boat there for wheat, and he traveled with that boat by way of Odessa, because previously the fundraisers and other people feared traveling by way of Odessa, because they said, that the sea (-the Black Sea) is dangerous in that way, and he in his great wisdom understood immediately that it was better for many reasons to travel by boat from Odessa, because it shortens considerably the distance that there is from our country to Galutz (-name of the coastal city in Romania), (and) also one is saved from the danger that there is when traveling from Galutz, for there is great danger when descending from the River Tuna (-Danube) unto the sea, as is well-known, therefore he did not pay any attention to what the world says, and he traveled from Nicoalayev by way of Odessa to Istanbul.</p>

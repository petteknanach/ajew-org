he would know great things only from what his eyes see, because they
see always, but he does not know what he sees. Like for example when
they pass a thing before the eyes of the person in passing and in
great speed, then the person does not know what he saw. And behold
even though at the hour that they passed the thing before his eyes
certainly he saw it in seeing complete, with all this he does not
know what he saw because even though his eyes saw the thing in
completeness, with all this because of the speed there was no leisure
enough that he bring the seeing to the knowledge that he know what he
saw. For to know the thing that he saw this depends on the knowledge
and for this one needs a little time that he delay a little the thing
the seen before his eyes enough that he bring the power of seeing to
the knowledge the thing the seen to know in the knowledge what he
saw. And because of the speed he saw the thing only in power of
seeing but there was no time to extend the thing to the knowledge.
And therefore he does not know what he saw. And similarly the person
sees in his eyes always great things [that is visions and visions

sights or revelations</font></font></font><font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">]].
But it is like that they pass before him in passing in general and in
great speed therefore he does not know what he saw as above, and
understand [</font></font></font><font color="#0000ff"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">implying

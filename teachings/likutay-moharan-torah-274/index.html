<font color="#333333"><font face="Georgia, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">Know
that there are wicked who labor and toil all their days to uproot
themselves completely from Hashem, blessed be He, and from His Torah.
Because the holy point of Israel's holiness that is still within
them—even though they are complete wicked—confuses them and
brings them thoughts of repentance and fear from the fear of the
great judgment. And because of this, they have no pleasure from their
transgressions and desires. Therefore, they desire and toil to reach
complete denial in their knowledge, G-d forbid, in a way that they
have no remaining side of doubt to incline toward the truth. But they
need for this very, very great toil, many, many years, may the
Merciful save us, may the Merciful deliver us. Because the Judaism
within them does not let them be and confuses them always. And know
that there are some of them who, when they reach and come to what
they desired—that is, to complete denial, G-d forbid, without any
doubt toward the truth—then immediately they die [from the world],
and then they see the truth.</font></font></font></p>

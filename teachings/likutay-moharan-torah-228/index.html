that when the Holy One blessed be He gazes on the soul that can
return people in repentance and to make converts then He, blessed be
He, Himself as if requests and sees that there should be controversy
on him because they do not accept converts in the days of the Messiah
and not in the days of Solomon (Yevamos 24) because of the table of
kings because then they do not convert from love only because of that
they see the greatness of Israel and the main converts is when they
convert at the time that Israel are washed in poverty and pressure as
it is written &quot;Who dwells with you in your poverty&quot; [Isaiah
54] etc. (there in the Gemara) and therefore necessarily that there
be controversy on who returns people for good and converts converts
in order that he should not have any tranquility because then who
draws close to him is in truth and then he can convert converts in
truth not because of peace and rest as above and this is &quot;And
Jacob dwelt in the land of the sojournings of his father&quot;
[Genesis 37] and there is in the Midrash (Bereishis Parsha 84)
&quot;sojournings of his father&quot; that he converted converts like
his fathers, like conversions of his father and this that our Rabbis,
their memory for blessing, said (there): &quot;And Jacob dwelt&quot;
Jacob sought to dwell in tranquility, immediately jumped on him the
anger of Joseph that is because of that Jacob was converting
converts, aspects of &quot;sojournings of his father&quot; by this he
could not dwell in tranquility in order that the converts should be
in truth and if he has tranquility he cannot make converts because
they do not accept converts in the days of the Messiah as above.</font></font></font></p>

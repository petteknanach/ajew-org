when the friendship in completeness by this the trust in completeness
because the main trust in completeness is by the intellect as it is
written &quot;The eyes of all look to You&quot; [Psalms 145] eyes
this is aspects of the intellect as it is written &quot;And the eyes
of both were opened&quot; [Genesis 3], and Rashi explained on the
name of wisdom it is said and according to the intellect so is the
trust because there are several levels and degrees in trust until
without end aspects of &quot;Trust in G-d forever&quot; [Isaiah 26]
and all according to the intellect as above and the main intellect by
the friendship because the main intellect is by the moisture that
rises to the brain that they are aspects of the oil and the brain is
the wick and the soul in the brain is the light it is found that the
main existence of the intellect is by the moisture in the body as
above and the moisture is by the friendship as brought (in Tikkunei
Zohar 27:): If not for the wings of the lung that blow on the heart
the heart would burn all the body and this is aspects of &quot;And
the keruvim spreading wings over the cover&quot; [Exodus 25] cover of
the heart (Zohar Pinchas 234) it is found that by the friendship the
moisture exists, that it should not dry by the heart and by this the
existence of the intellect that is aspects of a burning candle by the
moisture as above and by the intellect, by this the trust is made as
above it is found that completeness of the trust is by completeness
of the friendship as above. And then they can make from the chirping
that is the voice that goes out from the windpipe that is only a
simple voice and chirping that it should be made speech by five
outlets of the mouth that cut the speech because the main difference
that there is between man and animal is by cutting of the speech that
it is the definition of man that he speaks aspects of &quot;Who
placed a mouth for man&quot; [Exodus 4] and the main difference is
cutting the speech that is that man makes from the chirping, and the
voice cutting of the letters and the speech because also animals and
birds have voice and chirping only that they do not have cutting of
the letters and the speech and this is the definition of man that he
can cut the speech as above and to come to aspects of definition of
man, it is by charity, aspects of &quot;Let us make man&quot;
[Genesis 1] and it is written &quot;The name of the man with whom I
did today&quot; [Ruth 2] etc. what there charity also here charity as
it is written in the Zohar (brought above in sign 37) that is that by
charity is made aspects of man, that it is aspects of speech as above
and this is (Rosh Hashanah 6): &quot;In your mouth&quot; this is
charity because by charity is made the mouth that is the speech that
it is aspects of definition of the man aspects of: &quot;Who placed a
mouth for man&quot; and the main charity is by the trust, aspects of
&quot;Trust in G-d and do good&quot; [Psalms 37] because if he has no
trust he cannot do charity properly because he fears that it will
lack him what he gives to charity and the main charity is by trust
that he trusts in G-d that he will not lose and not lack by the
charity at all because Hashem, blessed be He, will bless him because
of this thing etc. it is found that by the trust that it is by the
intellect by this they do charity and by this the speech is made as
above and this is aspects of &quot;My throat is parched my eyes fail&quot;
[Psalms 69] that is when the intellect is not in completeness,
aspects of &quot;my eyes fail&quot; that is the intellect and then he
has no trust as above, aspects of &quot;my eyes fail waiting for my
G-d&quot; then &quot;my throat is parched&quot;, that is that he has
no cutting of the speech as above but when he has trust and does
charity as above then he can make from the voices of the chirpings
speeches as above and this is aspects of &quot;And he rises to the
voice of the bird and all daughters of song are bowed&quot;
[Ecclesiastes 12] and our Rabbis, their memory for blessing,
expounded (Shabbos 152): that all the songs are like conversation to
him that is that it should be made from chirpings and songs,
conversation and speech as above and this is aspects of what they
tell about the Baal Shem Tov his memory for blessing that he would
hear speeches from the voice of the violin because he would make from
chirpings speeches as above.</font></font></font></p>

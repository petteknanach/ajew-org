Afterwards he grew older, and when he became bar mitzvah, his uncle the holy Rav our teacher Rav Efraim za.tza.l., the head of the bais din (court) of the holy community of Sidilkov, called him over and told him the verse (Psalms 2:7), "I have given birth to you today" (because this is said the day that a a man becomes bar mitzvah as is brought down in the holy books (see Rashi there, and Zohar Chudush 10)). And he told him a few sparse words of ethics (mussar) and it was very extremely precious in his eyes "like finding a huge treasure/spoils (Psalms 119:162)." And afterwards he entered the chupa (wedding canopy), and immediately upon his leaving the chupa he was extremely impassioned and yearned extremely for the devotion of Hashem Yisburach and he entered (advanced into) the devotion of Hashem from day to day.

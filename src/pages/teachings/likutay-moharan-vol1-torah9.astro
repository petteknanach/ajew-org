FREEDOM - LIBERTY - EMANCIPATION Sunday, July 20, 2025 Likutay Moharan - Torah-teaching 9 Likutay Moharan 9 Tehomet Yechasyumu [In the language of our Rebbe, his memory for blessing] Depths covered them, they descended in depths etc. (Exodus 15:5) 1. Because main the vitality receive from the tefillah (prayer) as it is written "Prayer to G-d of my life" (Psalms 42:9) and for this needs to pray with all his strength because when prays with all his strength and inserts his strength in letters of the tefillah (prayer) then renewed his strength there in aspect of "New in the mornings much Your faith" (Lamentations 3:23) etc. because faith she tefillah (prayer) as it is written "And was his hands faith" (Exodus 17:12) its targum: spread in prayer 2. And know, that there twelve tribes against twelve constellations (Tikkun 18, and in tikkun 21) and every tribe and tribe there to him version special and there to him gate special to enter through there his prayer and every tribe arouses in his prayer strength of his constellation that in twelve constellations and the constellation illuminates below and grows the plant and rest of his things the needed to him and this interpretation "Steps star from Jacob and rises tribe from Israel" (Numbers 24:17) and rises this aspect of standing, aspect of prayer when tribe from Israel stands to pray by this arouses star and the star steps and strikes the things that grow as said our sages, their memory for blessing (Bereshit Rabbah, parashah 10). No to you herb from below that no to him star and angel from above, that strikes him and says to him: Grow! And this that said our sages, their memory for blessing (Pesachim 118a) difficult his sustenances as splitting of sea of reed and difficult his coupling [as splitting of sea of reed] etc. (Sotah 2a) because the sea of reed split to twelve splits against twelve tribes (Pirkei deRabbi Eliezer, 42, see Tikkun 21 59a) and children of Israel in their prayer cause coupling of Holy Blessed He and His Shekhinah as it is written "Pave for rider of arabot" (Psalms 68:5) rider, this Holy Blessed He arabot, this His Shekhinah that mixed in her all the colors and according to the coupling that causes in his prayer so merits to his coupling and the prayer they twelve versions therefore the coupling as splitting of sea of reed that they twelve and also Israel sustain their father that in heaven in their prayer as it is written (Psalms 105:44): "And set it to Jacob for statute" and statute language of sustenance he (Beitzah 16a) and there is no standing but prayer (Berakhot 6b) and this interpretation "Keep His testimonies and statute gave to them" (Psalms 99:7) testimony this prayer, as it is written "Tribes of Yah testimony to thank to name of Hashem" (Psalms 122:4) also said our sages, their memory for blessing (Shevuot 30a): no testimony but in standing and standing this prayer that we testify on His unity and according to that sustain to his father in heaven in his prayer so given to him his sustenance and this: difficult sustenances as splitting of sea of reed that is sustenances divided to twelve paths according to twelve prayers tribes of Yah and needs to this merit great that merit man to raise his prayer through gate the belonging to his tribe and this that said Abba Binyamin (Berakhot 5b). All my days I was pained on two things: on my prayer that be adjacent to my bed that is as above, that pray through gate of his staff because there twelve staffs and every one there to him gate special and prayed on that not distance his prayer from his staff and this language of staff, because staff language of coupling as the statement adjacent: on my bed that be given etc. and bed he aspect of coupling also staff she aspect of sustenance as it is written "In my breaking to you staff of bread" (Leviticus 26:26) because twelve staffs cause coupling and sustain as above difficult their coupling and difficult his sustenances etc. also prayed on his tribe that merit to two tables and this is: and on my bed that be given between north to south and said our sages, their memory for blessing (Bava Batra 25b). One who wants to become wise etc., one who wants to become rich etc. and Jacob, that he included all the twelve tribes and was knowing every staff and staff in its root for this written in him (Genesis 49:33): "And Jacob gathered his feet to the bed" his feet this aspect of prayer as it is written "Righteousness before Him walks" (Psalms 85:14) (see Berakhot 14b) that is, that was gathering all the prayers, every one to its root also was power in his hand to give portion from portions of world to Joseph as it is written (Genesis 48:22): "And I gave to you Shechem one on your brothers" etc. because by his prayer was influencing vitality to all three portions of world that they world the low and world the stars and world the angels. And this Shechem low, star, angel because all this merited by his prayer as it is written (there): "That I took from hand etc. in my prayer and my request" 3. But when man stands to pray then come thoughts foreign and klipot and surround him and remains in the darkness and not can to pray as it is written "You fenced in cloud to You from passing prayer" (Lamentations 3:44) and it is written "Around wicked walk" (Psalms 12:9) that the wicked, that is the klipot, surround him as krom zullut that is at time of the prayer that she stands in height of world (Berakhot 6b) and know, that there openings many in the darkness this to go out from there as said our sages, their memory for blessing (Yoma 38b). One who comes to impure, open to him there to him openings many (see Tosafot Shabbat 104a) found, that there openings many in the darkness also to go out from there. But the man he blind and not knows to find the opening. And know, that by truth merit to find the opening because main the light the illuminating he the Holy One blessed be He as it is written "Hashem my light and my salvation" (Psalms 27:1) and by falsehood he removes the Holy One blessed be He as it is written "Not bear name of Hashem to falsehood" (Exodus 20:7) because by falsehood removes the Holy One blessed be He because "Speaker of lies not established before My eyes" (Psalms 101:7) but by truth, the Holy One blessed be He dwells with him as it is written "Near Hashem to all His callers to all that call Him in truth" (Psalms 145:18) etc. and when the Holy One blessed be He with him he illuminates to him how to go out from the darkness the preventing him in his prayer as it is written: "Hashem my light" and this interpretation: (Genesis 6:16) "Window you make to the ark" interpreted Rashi: There are who say window, and there are who say stone precious and the difference between window to stone precious because the window no to him light in itself but through there enters the light but when no light, not illuminates but stone precious even when no light from outside he illuminates in itself so there people that speech of them he window and no [to the] power to illuminate, to them in themselves and this: there are who say, and saying of them made window and there that saying of them made stone precious and illuminates and know, that all according to greatness of the truth because main the light he the Holy One blessed be He and the Holy One blessed be He he essence of the truth and main longing of the Name blessed be He only to the truth and this: "And to cubit finish it from above" language of (2 Samuel 13:32): "And finish soul of David" cubit she five out</p>

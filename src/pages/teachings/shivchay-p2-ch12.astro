      <p>And on the next day he came and said that a boat came from chutz-lu'uretz (-anywhere outside of Israel) with Jews, and they also have a distinct (-highly qualified and experienced) butcher, and there, on that boat, was the Rav the Chusid (-pious) the famous, our teacher the Rav Zi'aiv Wolf may his flame shine, from Tcharney-Austria, and other important people, and they asked about Rabbainu o.b.m., and the man who was with Rabbainu o.b.m. revealed to them the truth, and immediately the aforementioned Rabbi Zi'aiv sent after Rabbainu o.b.m. that he should come to him to his lodging and he will receive him with love to stay with him together, but Rabbainu o.b.m. did not want to go to be by him, because he said: "Here is good before me," because in Istanbul he did all types of puerile things, and he went about barefoot and without a belt and without a formal hat, and he was dressed just in the "inter-shlack" (-inner lining) that he had from some garment, and he would go about in the marketplace in the way of the youth, who run and play in the marketplace, and he waged recreational battles as the youth do, and they would call one person by the name of France, and another - with a different (country's) name, ‎and they waged war, and it was like actual tactical battle, and he would do very many puerile things there in Istanbul.</p>
      <p>Afterwards the plague fell, may the Merciful One save us, in this "chan" i.e. courtyard, and he was forced to flee from there. And he was forced to enter the lodging of the aforementioned Rabbi Zi'aiv, and he (R.Z.) made for him a great feast, and the aforementioned Rav, Rabbi Zi'aiv accorded him very, very great immeasurable respect, and Rabbainu o.b.m. did many things then that were against the desire of the aforementioned Rabbi Zi'aiv, but even still (Beraishis Rabah 55:11)- "love distorts (-disregards) the line (-manner of course)," and because of his enormous love he did not pay any attention to this, even though it was great wonderments in his eyes, because every time Rabbi Zi'aiv would pray before the lectern (-lead the service) on Shabbos, as is the way of the famous rabbis, Rabbainu o.b.m. would eat at that time, because he would pray earlier, so that when Rabbi Zi'aiv was praying, he o.b.m. would eat his meal.</p>
      <p>And so it was on the night of Shabbos, and on Shabbos morning, and by the third meal of Shabbos, and when Rabbi Zi'aiv sat down for the third meal, Rabbainu had already blessed the grace after meals (-birchas hamazoan), and ordered the man that was with him that he should see you whether there were stars (-nightfall, the end of Shabbos, is officially determined by the visibility of three medium sized stars. However, in all probability Rabbainu would have been accustomed to end Shabbos 72 minutes after sunset, which in Israel is much later than the appearance of three stars. So this instance is cited by many as a precedence to not having to keep the full 72 minutes), and he immediately prayed arvis (-night prayer) and made havdala (-ritual separation between Shabbos and the weekdays), and he took the pipe and entered into the house of Rabbi Zi'aiv, and he (R.Z.) had recently began the third meal, as is the way of the famous rabbis (-to begin the third meal late (this is also somewhat based on their keeping Shabbos at least 72 minutes after sunset)). And immediately when Rabbainu entered there without a formal hat and without a belt and the pipe in his hand, the aforementioned Rabbi Zi'aiv immediately received him with great honor, and promptly blessed the grace after meals, and prayed arvis, and made havdala, and spoke with Rabbainu o.b.m. almost the entire night, and there was great love between them. And Rabbainu o.b.m. did all types of puerile things there as mentioned above, and there, he was by the grave of Rabbi Naftoli o.b.m. (Katz, author of Smichas Chachumim and many other works including poetry and songs, a huge kabalist and holy saint).</p>
      <p>And everything that transpired over him in Istanbul physically and spiritually, many folios would be insufficient to tell it over, and according to what can be understood from his words, he was in enormous and dire danger there, and he thought that for certain he would remain there, that is, he would pass away there, however, Hashem Yisburach did with him many miracles, and he traversed over everything, and the aforementioned puerility availed him tremendously. Also when he came from the grave of Rabbi Naftoli, he fell suddenly to the ground, and he lay that way for many hours, and afterwards they placed him on the bed, and he lay there the whole night until midday of the morrow, and he lay as if he had died, until Hashem Yisburach helped him, (so) that he got up from his bed and returned to his strength. And he had great dangerous, many and enormous, and unlimited impediments there at all times and at every moment, and he said, that the aforementioned degradations and the puerility availed him tremendously as mentioned above.</p>

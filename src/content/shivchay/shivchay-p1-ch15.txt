And similarly with all types of fences (-restrictions) and safeguards of abstinence from some (bodily) desire or some character trait, he was very frequent with vows many times, and many times he made an oath (shivoo-uh) binikeetas (while holding) chaifetz (an article - such as a Torah scroll, such an oath has much greater severity) over something, in order that he be strong to abstain from that thing that he wanted to abstain (himself from).

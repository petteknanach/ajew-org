<p><strong>Shivchay Haran</strong> (שבחי הר"ן - Praises of Rabbi Nachman) is the second part of "The Life of Our Leader Rabbi Nachman" (Hayom Yom / HH).</p>
<p>This sacred collection contains heartfelt testimonials from Rabbi Nachman's closest disciples - those who knew him intimately and witnessed his extraordinary holiness firsthand. These accounts describe his unique wisdom, his incredible humility, his profound Torah insights, and his extraordinary spiritual power.</p>
<p>Unlike formal biographies, Shivchay Haran captures the personal recollections and emotional experiences of those who lived with Rabbi Nachman, loved him, and were transformed by his teachings. The stories reveal not only his greatness as a tzadik (righteous one), but also his accessibility and warmth toward his followers.</p>
<p>Through these pages, we gain intimate glimpses into:</p>
<p>• His daily practices and devotion to God<br/>
• His extraordinary level of faith and trust (bitachon)<br/>
• His profound humility and selflessness<br/>
• His amazing joy even in times of suffering<br/>
• His concern for every individual soul<br/>
• His predictions and words of encouragement that continue to inspire Breslovers today</p>
<p>Reading Shivchay Haran connects us across centuries to the living presence of Rabbi Nachman, whose light continues to guide and inspire those who seek truth and closeness to God.</p>

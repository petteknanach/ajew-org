And the trip to Kaminitz was a very great wonder, and the whole world said interpretations on it: some propounded positively, and some etc. - but they all erred. Even those that said praisingly did not get his intention whatsoever, and even those that knew a little because he himself revealed to them some hint, even still they did not know his intention completely. And he already said an apt construct pertaining this, regarding what the world always mistake themselves in him with all that he does etc. (Life of Our Leader Rabbi Nachman 200).

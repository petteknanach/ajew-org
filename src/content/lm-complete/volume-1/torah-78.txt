FREEDOM - LIBERTY - EMANCIPATION Tuesday, July 22, 2025 Likutay Moharan - Torah-teaching 78 78 And He gives strength to His king and exalts the horn of His anointed And He gives strength to His king and exalts the horn of His anointed [1 Samuel 2:10] [In the language of the friends] Behold, there is in this the aspect of Mashiach [ Messiah ], Ruach HaKodesh [ Holy Spirit ], unification of Kudsha Brich Hu [ Holy One, Blessed be He ] and His Shekhinah [ Divine Presence ], and tchiyah [ resurrection ]. The beginning of the creation was in order that His attribute of Malchus [ Sovereignty ] be revealed. And because of the greatness of His illumination, it was not possible to receive, and He was forced to contract within olamos [ worlds ], as it is written: "Your Malchus is the Malchus of all olamos" [Psalms 145:13]. That is, that the attribute of Malchus clothed itself within olamos in order that we can receive. And there is no one who will accept upon His Malchus , therefore the souls of Yisroel [ Israel ] emerge, that they accept upon His Malchus , because there is no king without a people. And from where do the souls of Yisroel emerge? From the world of dibbur [ speech ], as it is written: "My soul went out when he spoke" [Song of Songs 5:6]. That is, that the souls of Yisroel emerge from the world of dibbur . And the dibbur is the aspect of Malchus , as Eliyahu said, &#8220; Malchus is the mouth&#8221; [ Tikkunei Zohar, Petach Eliyahu ]. And aspects of Shekhinah also, because it dwells with them constantly without a moment's break, as it is written: "Who dwells with them in the midst of their impurities" [Leviticus 16:16] (see Yoma 57a and Midrash Rabbah Naso 87:6 ). And it is the aspect of "Mother of children" [Psalms 113:9]. That is, like the mother goes constantly with her children, and does not forget them, so the dibbur , which is the aspect of Shekhinah , goes with the person constantly, as it is written: "For whenever I speak of him, I surely remember him" [Jeremiah 31:20]. That is, as we said, that the dibbur remembers him constantly and goes with him even to the place of filth. And this is the aspect of the exile of the Shekhinah , that the dibbur , which is the aspect of the Shekhinah , is in exile, as it is written: "I was mute with silence" [Psalms 39:3] and "Indeed, in silence, righteousness you speak" [Psalms 58:2]. That is, because righteousness this is Malchus K&#8217;disha [ Holy Sovereignty ] as known [ Tikkunei Zohar, Petach Eliyahu ]. And Malchus , it is the dibbur as above, when it is in exile it is mute. And therefore, with what he damaged he shall rectify, that is, vidui d&#8217;varim [ confession with words ], as it is written: "Take with you words" [Hosea 14:3], that he confess constantly with all his heart "before the face of my Lord." Then, "and return to G-d," that all the words that he damaged will return to their root. And this is the aspect of unification of Kudsha Brich Hu and His Shekhinah , because he unifies the dibbur , which is the aspect of the Shekhinah as above, to the letter ה ( Hay [ fifth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, representing the Divine Name ]). And this is also what the verse said: "And the glory of G-d shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see together that the mouth of G-d has spoken" [Isaiah 40:5]. That is, when he unifies the dibbur with ה ( Hay ), which is unification of Kudsha Brich Hu and His Shekhinah as above, then "and the glory of G-d shall be revealed." Glory, this is Shekhinah as known. That is, that the illumination of the Shekhinah is revealed and magnified, which is the aspect of Malchus , because now its light is diminished and its strength weakened, as it is written in the holy Zohar (in Tikkun 6 of the later Tikkunim, 122b): that the Shekhinah cries: "Support me with raisin cakes, etc., because I am sick with love" [Song of Songs 2:5]. That is, love of Yisroel, that I dwell with them even in the midst of their impurities. And this is the exile of the Shekhinah . But as we said, [by means of] that he rectifies the partzuf [ spiritual configuration ] of Malchus and unifies the dibbur , which is the aspect of Malchus and aspect of Shekhinah with ה ( Hay ), the light of the partzuf of Malchus will be revealed and magnified, as it is written: "In the light of the king's face is life" [Proverbs 16:15]. That is, [by means of] that he gives illumination in the partzuf of Malchus he can live, because he draws life from the attribute of Malchus , which is his root as above. And also this is the aspect of Ruach HaKodesh . Because what a person lives, is only because of that he breathes breaths. And what is breathing? That he expels and brings in the ruach [ spirit/wind ]. And this is the aspect of "The living creatures running and returning" [Ezekiel 1:14]. And therefore, when a person is attached to Malchus K&#8217;disha and speaks Torah [ Scripture ] or tefillah [ prayer ], he expels and brings in Ruach HaKodesh . And this is "And a new spirit I will put within you" [Ezekiel 36:26]. That is, your innards, when he breathes a breath of holiness, then, "And a new spirit I will put," that is, Ruach HaKodesh . And this is "And the Ruach of Elokim hovering over the face of the waters" [Genesis 1:2]. That is, when he studies Torah , because mayim [ waters ] this is Torah (see Taanit 7a , Bava Kama 17a , 82a ) as known, then, "And the Ruach of Elokim," which is Ruach HaKodesh "hovering" and covers over him, and he draws spirit of life. Because without Torah it is impossible to live, as it is written (in Tikkunei Zohar Tikkun 13, 27b ): If not for the kanfay ray&#8217;ah [ wings of the lung ] that blow on the heart, the heart would burn the entire body. And the lung this is mayim [ Zohar Pinchas 218b ], and mayim this is Torah . Because when the Israelite man burns in his heart for Hashem, blessed be He, it would be possible to burn the entire body. But when he clothes in the letters of the Torah or tefillah , it protects and saves upon him. And similarly, chas v&#8217;shalom [ G-d forbid ], to the opposite, when he burns to the desires of this world, it would burn also the entire body. But when after that he studies Torah or does a mitzvah [ commandment ], it protects and saves upon him, and he can live because he draws spirit of life, which is Ruach HaKodesh from the attribute of Malchus which is his root [ Berachos 18a ]. Because because of that he is cut off from the rope of holiness, from where will he have vitality? And he draws spirit of foolishness because he is attached to "an old and foolish king" [Ecclesiastes 4:13]. And this is what our rabbis said, of blessed memory [ Sotah 3a ]: A person does not commit a transgression unless a spirit of foolishness enters him. But to the opposite, Ruach HaKodesh enters him. And Ruach HaKodesh is aspects of Malchus as the verse said "And Esther clothed Malchus" [Esther 5:1] and our rabbis expounded, of blessed memory [ Megillah 14a ]: that she clothed Ruach HaKodesh . And aspect of tchiyah also, as Rashi explained on the verse "And the spirit of Jacob lived" [Genesis 45:27] that Ruach HaKodesh rested upon him. And this is the aspect of Mashiach because it is written by him "Not by the sight of his eyes will he judge" etc. [Isaiah 11:3] but all with Ruach HaKodesh because then the partzuf of Malchus will be rectified in perfection and all the aspect of Malchus will be gathered to its root "And the kingdom will be to G-d" [Obadiah 1:21] "And G-d will be king over all the earth" [Zechariah 14:9] and we
